<p class="center">“Aperire terram gentibus.”</p>

<p>In the month of October, 1854, I left Europe
for Egypt, in consequence of an invitation
I had received from the new Viceroy, Mohammed
Saïd, who for twenty years has honoured
me with his friendship. I had no mission from
my Government. It was in the course of a
journey across the Libyan desert from Alexandria
to Cairo which I made in company with
the Prince, that the question of cutting through
the Isthmus of Suez, was for the first time
mooted between us. He requested me to draw
up a memorial on the subject, (<a href="#APPENDIX_I">Appendix, No.
1</a>) and, as my ideas met with his approbation,
he issued to the Consuls General of foreign
powers a firman (<a href="#APPENDIX_II">Appendix, No. 2</a>), destined
to receive the sanction of the Sultan, granting
to a company composed of the capitalists of all
nations without distinction, the right to construct
a canal between the two Seas. Mr. Bruce,
the agent of the British Government, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
first of the Consuls General who was informed
of the Viceroy’s project, so that France and
England received intimation of it at the same
time.</p>

<p>MM. Linant Bey and Mougel Bey, engineers,
who have been engaged, the one for the last
twenty, the other for the last thirty years, in
the construction of important hydraulic works
in Egypt, were appointed by the Viceroy to
accompany me in an exploring expedition to
the Isthmus of Suez, and to complete, by a fresh
examination of the ground, the investigations
they had already made.</p>

<p>This expedition was made during last December
and January; after presenting an account
of it to His Highness Mohammed Saïd,
I gave instructions (<a href="#APPENDIX_III">Appendix, No. 3</a>), in his
name, to the engineers, calculated to assist them
in the preparation of their report.</p>

<p>In the month of March, MM. Linant Bey
and Mougel Bey delivered the precursory
scheme (<a href="#APPENDIX_IV">Appendix, No. 4</a>), which quite convinced
the Viceroy of the possibility of executing
this great undertaking in which he has taken
the initiative. They establish by calculations
and data, which may be verified by any one, that
a maritime canal direct from Suez to Pelusium
thirty leagues long, one hundred metres wide,
and eight metres deep, extending sufficiently far
into the two seas by means of jetties, to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the depth necessary to enable ships to enter
without difficulty, having an inland port in the
natural basin of Lake Timsah, and which should
be completed in six years, would cost, at the
most, 160,000,000 francs, (£6,400,000); or,
about half the amount expended on the Great
Northern railway from London to York, or on
that between Paris and Lyons.</p>

<p>In a journey that I made to Constantinople,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
I ascertained that the Sultan and his ministers
were favourable to the project, and I delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to the Viceroy a letter from the Grand Vizier,
in which he aptly characterized the opening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the Isthmus of Suez by a maritime canal as a
work of the most useful and interesting character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
(<a href="#APPENDIX_V">Appendix, No. 5.</a>) His Highness immediately
transmitted to the Divan, the documents,
maps, and plans necessary for understanding
the question of construction, and which were
required for obtaining the sanction of the Sovereign.</p>

<p>I was then commissioned to return to Europe
for the purpose of calling public attention to
the subject and to take measures for organizing
the undertaking, on a cosmopolitan basis in
accordance with the principles which have from
the commencement guided the projectors.</p>

<p>Prince Mohammed Saïd has declared in his
instructions (<a href="#APPENDIX_VI">Appendix, No. 6</a>), that the labours
of his engineers, who at this moment are engaged
in preparing their definitive scheme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
shall be submitted to the judgment of engineers,
chosen from England, from France, from Holland,
from Germany, and from Italy; and that
the organization of the Universal Company entrusted
with the construction of the Canal shall
be based upon the scientific decision of Europe.</p>

<p>Until then no call will be made on the shareholders,
and, the administration of the Company
being in the hands of capitalists and other persons
of all nations, in proportion to the relative
commercial importance of their country, they
will not support the undertaking unless they are
convinced that it will be to their interest to do so.</p>

<p>As England is evidently interested more than
any other power in the construction of a canal
through the Isthmus of Suez, my first step has
been to come to London, both in order to ascertain
the state of public opinion in England on
this question, and also to give to all who desire
it such information as will enable them fully to
appreciate the moral and material aspects of the
undertaking.</p>

<p>I have already remarked with satisfaction
that, in general, men of intelligence with whom
I have had the honour of conversing on the
subject, do not admit that an event which would
advance the interests of the whole world, could
possibly do injury to the power or commerce
of England. They frankly discard all idea of
a prejudice against the project; they assert on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the contrary, that if feasible their country cannot
but gain by it, and that it would be a source
of regret if the idea were entertained in France
that what would be beneficial to other countries
should not be of equal benefit to England.</p>

<p>Objections, however, which to my mind, I am
proud to acknowledge, do honour to the candour
of English politicians, have been made, in
perfectly good faith, and without any feeling
of distrust towards a friendly nation, the alliance
with which, cemented by the blood of their
brave armies, has been recently sanctioned by
the unanimous demonstration of the English
people, as it will shortly be by the people of
France.</p>

<p>I shall reproduce these objections, and reply
to them in very few words.</p>

<p>I begin by setting aside all those which relate
to the supposed impossibility of execution,
and to the idea that the canal can only be constructed
at an expenditure out of proportion to
the advantages reasonably to be expected.</p>

<p>If the canal should be found to be physically
impossible, of course the scheme will not be
entertained, and if European science should not
make it clear that the advantages to be derived
are commensurate with the expenses to be incurred,
capitalists will not come forward.</p>

<p>The report of the engineers replies triumphantly
to other objections respecting the sands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the desert, the alluvial deposits at Pelusium
and Suez, and the navigation of the Red Sea.</p>

<p>It has been affirmed that the project of a
canal might retard the construction of a railway
from Alexandria to Suez, which the policy of
England has always considered essential to her
Indian interests.</p>

<p>Far from being retarded by the canal project,
the railway will, on the contrary, be indebted
to this very design, for its speedy completion;
for it can only obtain sufficient returns
from the activity occasioned by a considerable
maritime commerce across the Isthmus of Suez.
The Egyptian Government, which has already
completed, at its own expense, the first two sections
of the railway, viz., from Alexandria to the
Nile, and from the Nile to Cairo, takes this view
of the question, and is at the same time desirous
of giving satisfaction to England, whose main
object is to secure for her despatches and travellers
the most direct and speedy route. The
Viceroy, being thus persuaded, that of the two
undertakings, the railway and the canal, each
forms the complement of the other, has just
decided on the completion of the third section,
from Cairo to Suez. He has given the order
for the rails to an English house, and engineers
are at this moment engaged in levelling and in
the superintendence of the earth-works.</p>

<p>It has also been said that if a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
number of European workmen, or agricultural
labourers, were taken to the Isthmus of Suez,
there would be some fear of their forming a
colony of natives of one single country—of
France for instance—which might have a prejudicial
effect on the policy of England. In
the first place, there is no motive for a universal
company to employ, for a special political
object, workmen of any one country in preference
to those of any other. Again, it is not
necessary to demonstrate that a company of
capitalists will attend to their own interests,
and they will certainly have an incontestable
advantage in employing Egyptians only, as
workmen and agricultural labourers. The
<i>fellah</i> of Egypt has alone constructed, under
the direction of skilful and experienced engineers
and foremen, all the extensive works
undertaken in that country, and no nation can
more easily, or on more favourable terms, furnish
disciplined armies, of robust, active, and
intelligent workmen, equally fit for the construction
of canals, for hydraulic and for agricultural
operations.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But what is of greater moment, and indeed
alone deserves the consideration of a people who
have the fortunate custom of interesting themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in their political affairs, is the apprehension
conscientiously entertained by statesmen,
whose right and whose duty it is to ask themselves
and maturely to consider:—</p>

<p>1. Whether shortening the distance by 3000
leagues for all the countries of Northern Europe,
and by 3400 leagues on an average for the
ports of the Mediterranean, including Malta,
may not in future, in case of war, menace the
safety of the British possessions in India.</p>

<p>2. Whether the commercial and maritime
relations of Great Britain will not be disadvantageously
affected by the opening of a new
route, which, while shortening the distance for
her own navigation, will at the same time facilitate
and increase the navigation of all other
nations towards the extreme East.</p>

<p>The following passage from a recent publication
replies to these objections:—</p>

<p>“The power in possession of Aden opens and
shuts at its will the Red Sea, and if it is true
that the influence of nations and governments
chiefly depends on the good they can do to
their friends and the harm they can do to
their enemies, that revolution would be of no
slight advantage to England which would lead
the principal current of the world’s commerce
under the guns of her ships and the batteries
of her fortresses. Besides, is it from the naval
armaments of the Mediterranean that England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
has most reason to fear an invasion of
India? It requires no more than ordinary
foresight to perceive, that if her Indian possessions
were ever seriously threatened, it
could only be from Russia by land, and from
North America by sea. In either case, the
safety of her possessions would depend on the
shortening of her line of operations.</p>

<p>“India is not the only British possession to
which the route will be abridged by the passage
<i>viâ</i> Suez. Australia will profit no less
by the change; and it will be all the more
necessary to facilitate the defence of that
country, as it will become, if the cutting
through of the Isthmus of Panama be effected,
more accessible to the ships of war
of the United States.</p>

<p>“We may conclude from these observations,
that there would be small risk of the opening
of the Isthmus of Suez weakening the military
power of Great Britain. Her commercial
power could only be compromised by it, if it
were possible for the multiplicity of her transactions
with the East Indies to be decreased
by shortening the intervening distance by
3000 leagues, or if it were possible for the
producers and sellers of the commodities of
the extreme East to lose by the consumption
of them in Europe being doubled.</p>

<p>“If England must gain by the opening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the Isthmus an increase of military and commercial
power, the genius of calculation within
her will soon triumph over an ill-considered
opposition. She will not sacrifice the positive
elevation, the basis of which is enlarged by
the developement of what surrounds it, to
that relative elevation which is satisfied with
the degradation of others, and she will not
give any one the right to attribute to her,
with regard to all the nations bordering on
the Mediterranean, the language lately addressed
by the Emperor Nicholas to the English
Minister on the subject of Greece, and of
the East. Such a policy she leaves to its fitting
home. She does more, she opposes it by
force of arms. Convinced that her strength
lies in her power of expansion, and in her
commercial capabilities, she endeavours by
the prosperity of her neighbours to enlarge
the basis of her own, and for this reason it
is that she animates with her co-operation so
many enterprises which enrich the Continent;
no undertaking that she has ever assisted will
prove more productive of beneficial results to
herself than the operations at the Isthmus of
Suez.”</p>

<p>To the preceding quotation, which is conclusive,
I add some figures which also have their
value.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean ports will profit, it is true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
by the opening of the Isthmus of Suez, but England
with the 5,000,000 tons employed in her
commerce—a tonnage greater than that of all
the navies of Europe, including France, united—cannot
fail to profit in a much greater degree
by the increase of relations which must necessarily
result from the shortening of the distance
between the points of traffic; to this opening
moreover she will be indebted for the inestimable
advantage of finding herself in closer connection
with her colonies, than another nation
whose competition might otherwise be really
formidable in the eyes of the upholders of an
exclusive system.</p>

<p>But on the contrary, England, adopting the
policy of commercial freedom, has been seen
to favour the attempts which have been made
to cut through the American Isthmus, although,
if successful, it would bring the United States
nearer the British possessions in India and still
nearer to Australia. She is not, however, ignorant
of the fact that the maritime commerce
of the United States, which twenty years ago
employed only 1,000,000 tons, now, in 1854,
requires no less than 5,400,000, and that this
vast tonnage, already larger than her own, is constantly
increasing. But England on her part
does not remain at a stand-still, and she has done
well in showing no fear of the contest. The
law of progress has been justified by official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
statistical documents. The burthen of the English
ships built in 1842 was 130,000 tons; in
1843, shipping to the amount of 203,000 tons
was built. It is especially since the relations
of the United States with the Indian Seas have
been extended, that the commerce of Great
Britain has in those very regions experienced
a still farther developement. Thus, the imports
from the Indian Peninsula, which in 1849
amounted to £9,238,000, had in 1853 increased
to £13,610,000. Those from China, which in
1849 were £6,200,000, rose in 1853, to
£8,300,000. Again, the tonnage employed in
the trade between Great Britain and her Eastern
possessions, including the other countries in
the Indian Seas, to and fro, amounted in 1849
to 967,076, and in 1853 to 1,595,138 tons.</p>

<p>It may perhaps not be superfluous to reply
to those persons who still believe in the supposed
monopoly which they think it advisable
for England to retain in her commerce with the
East; we have just seen that there is in fact
no such monopoly as far as the United States
are concerned, and that England does not suffer
from the want of it. It is the same with
respect to Europe. This state of things has a
tendency to increase every day, even with the
existing means of communication by the Cape
of Good Hope and the imperfect transit through
Egypt. Marseilles, Bordeaux, Havre, Genoa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Trieste, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Hamburg,
all despatch vessels direct to the Indies. Marseilles
and Trieste now receive, <i>viâ</i> Egypt, cases
of indigo from India and bales of silk goods from
China. Powerful companies, in anticipation of
peace, are at this moment engaged in building
ships expressly for trading to the East, or else
in devoting to that purpose the steamers and
sailing vessels now used as transports in the
Black Sea.</p>

<p>Other objections have been made, and as they
have been seriously brought forward, I cannot
allow them to pass without remark. Some
very modest Englishmen have compared their
country to Venice, and have contended, that if
Venice lost her power by the discovery of the
Cape of Good Hope, England would see hers
decline by a return to the shortest route. In
the first place, the shortest route is a geographical
fact which no one can get rid of, and, from
the moment that it is ascertained that no material
obstacle prevents the opening of this direct
line, it will not be for any Government,
much less for the one which has inaugurated
the era of commercial freedom, to oppose the
realization of a work which will satisfy the interests
of all. Then, Great Britain in the nineteenth
century cannot be compared to Venice
in the fifteenth: the latter, in consequence of her
defeats in 1291 and 1298, had been obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
cede the supremacy to Genoa, and, after having
still shone in the first rank when she put herself
at the head of the league against Charles VIII.
(1495), finally lost her preponderance when
the Portuguese destroyed her fleets in the Red
Sea, and the Emperor, the Pope and the kings
of France and Aragon formed the league of
Cambray against her (1508). It would be useless
to prove by historical evidence that the
decline of the Queen of the Adriatic was due
to other causes than the discovery of the Cape
(1497), by which she might have profited as
well as the Portuguese, if she had had the same
elements of strength and vitality. Trieste,
which has succeeded to her commercial prosperity,
and even surpassed it, has had no need
of the re-establishment of the ancient route to
India. If Trieste participates largely, as is to
be hoped, in the advantages of the Isthmus
Company, if her neighbour of the Adriatic finds
therein a new life, Great Britain will lose nothing
thereby. Has it ever been seen that a
capital city, brought into communication with
a great market by a railroad, has had to regret
the shortening of the distance and the amelioration
of its own relations, because some secondary
towns on the line were nearer to the market and
participated in the common benefit?</p>

<p>Marseilles, Trieste, Greece, the ports of Italy,
of Spain and of Turkey, are nearer to Egypt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
than London and Liverpool. Well; in the
present state of the relations of Europe with
Alexandria, England absorbs to herself alone
<i>half the value</i> of the commerce between all other
countries and Egypt, and her tonnage comprises
<i>two-thirds</i> of the navigation to and fro under all
flags.</p>

<p>I wrote the following from Cairo, December
3rd, 1854, to a friend of mine, a member of the
British Parliament.</p>

<p>“Some persons assert that the Viceroy of
Egypt’s project will meet with opposition in
England. I cannot believe it: your statesmen
are too enlightened for me to entertain
such a supposition under present circumstances.
What! England herself transacts
more than half the general commerce with
India and China; she has an immense empire
in Asia; she may reduce by one-third
the charges on her commerce, and bring that
Eastern Empire nearer by one-half; and she
would not allow it to be done. Wherefore?
To prevent the Mediterranean nations from
taking advantage of their situation to increase
their commerce in the Eastern Seas,—she
would deprive herself of the immense advantages
which must accrue to her, in material
respects, and in a political point of view,
from this new communication, solely because
others are more favourably situated than herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as if geographical position was all-in-all,
and as if, everything considered, England
had not more to gain by this work than all
the nations together. Finally, England, it is
said, must dread the reduction in the number
of vessels employed in Indian commerce which
would result from the diminution of more
than one-third in the duration of the voyage.
And has not England proved in her experience
of railways, by results which have surpassed
the boldest anticipations, that the
necessary consequence of shortening the distance
and diminishing the duration of a journey,
is the infinite augmentation of intercourse
and circulation. One cannot understand why
those who entertain this fear do not advise
the English Government to direct, that the
voyage to India now shall be <i>viâ</i> Cape Horn,
for that would employ still more ships than
the way by the Cape of Good Hope and
furnish better sailors.</p>

<p>“If, as is not unlikely, the difficulties with
which I am threatened should be brought
forward, public opinion, so powerful in England,
will soon do justice to interested opposition
and superannuated objections.”</p>

<p>Her Majesty’s Government concluded with
the United States, on the 19th of April, 1850,
a treaty of neutrality for the projected canal
through the American Isthmus. The cabinets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of London and Paris are now on such intimate
terms as to make it a matter of no difficulty for
them to agree upon a convention, if it suited
their political interests to do so, relative to the
passage of the Isthmus of Suez, assimilating it
to that of the Dardanelles. The other powers
would not fail to give in their adhesion to the
convention, which would be open to them.</p>

<p>In this manner commercial navigation would
be guaranteed against the chances of war, and
military armaments could neither remain in nor
pass through the Isthmus without the permission
of the Sovereign of the country.</p>

<p>The question of the importance to the commercial
interests of Great Britain of cutting
through the Isthmus of Suez, has been considered
in the most favourable light by the principal
men of science, engineers, economists, and
public writers of England. I shall quote hereafter
the opinions of Mr. Anderson, the present
director of the Peninsular and Oriental Company,
and of Captain James Vetch, R. E.,
from their respective works. (<a href="#APPENDIX_VIII">Appendix, Nos.
8 and 9.</a>) The fact of the question having been
frequently treated with favour by the press,
seems to show that it has already been accepted
by the feeling of the country; the remarkable
extract from the “Papers for the People” in
the memorial of the engineers (<a href="#APPENDIX_IV">Appendix, No. 4</a>)
will be read with interest. The celebrated novelist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Charles Dickens himself, has not disdained
to devote several eloquent pages to a
very practical consideration of the project for
constructing a canal through the Isthmus of
Suez.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that the English authors
who have written upon this question, have,
without exception, advocated the direct line
from Suez to Pelusium. This view is taken by
all the inhabitants of Egypt, and I doubt if the
indirect line, complicated as it is by traversing
the Nile, would have been adopted by two of
my compatriots so distinguished as M. Baude
and M. Paulin Talabot, if they had themselves
been on the spot before they gave their opinions.</p>

<p>The <i>Moniteur Universel</i> of France, in the
Number for the 6th of July, has proved the advantage
of the direct track over the indirect
one. I refer my readers to that article (<a href="#APPENDIX_IX">Appendix,
No. 9</a>).</p>

<p>It is incumbent on me to add, that, although
the two tracks may be entertained, theoretically
speaking, practically only one is now to be
thought of; for the Viceroy of Egypt, who consents
to the cutting of the Isthmus, has a perfect
right to refuse to allow the whole of Egypt
to be cut through. He has, in his written instructions,
specially charged me to make known
his declaration, which is in the following
terms:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>After having passed in review the numerous
projects submitted to various Governments or to
the public for more than fifty years, I grant
perfect liberty for the application of those means
that science shall recognise to be best to bring the
Red Sea and the Mediterranean into communication
at any point of the Isthmus, eastward
of the course of the Nile; but I declare that I
will not authorize the Grand Maritime Suez
Canal Company to adopt any track which shall
have its point of departure on the Mediterranean
coast, to the west of the Damietta
branch, and which shall traverse the course of
the Nile.</i>”</p>

<p>If it were necessary, reference might be made
to the East India Company, the merchants of
Australia, of Singapore, of Madras, of Calcutta
and of Bombay, the commercial houses
of the City, the shipowners of London and
Liverpool, the manufacturers of Manchester,
the proprietors of iron mines, the manufacturers
of machines, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company, the directors of banks
and of extensive industrial undertakings, the
Chambers of Commerce, the proprietors of coal-fields,
who in 1854 exported 1,309,251 tons of
coal, of the value of £2,127,156, an amount
which, immense as it already is, will be still farther
increased, and to a considerable extent,
by the opening of the Isthmus of Suez.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>I appeal to their interests, and leave the
decision to their judgment.</p>

<p>Lastly, the objection has been made, that
the canal project would not be received with
favour by the Turkish Government; but, like
every question in which the principle is just,
the consequences are infallible; and from whatever
point of view we regard this question of
the Isthmus of Suez, we see nothing but universal
benefit arise from it.</p>

<p>As I have already remarked, I met with no
opposition at Constantinople on the part of the
Porte. Turkey is aware that the Canal of the
two Seas is destined to add to her power and
prosperity, by bringing Constantinople nearer
by 4300 leagues to the Indian Ocean, and by
facilitating the communication with the Holy
Places of Arabia, the source of the authority
the Sultan possesses over his Mussulman population.</p>

<p>Turkey can rise from her present languor
only by borrowing capital and intelligence from
Europe. The prosperity of the East is intimately
connected at the present day with the
interests of civilization in general, and the most
effectual means of working its welfare, in connection
with that of humanity, is to break
down the barriers that still separate individuals,
races, and nations.</p>

<p>War and commerce have civilized the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
War will have played out its part with that
last effort which is being made under our eyes.
The victories hereafter to be gained will be those
of commerce only. Let us exert ourselves to
open up for her a new route. This object may
be pursued and attained—in the words of a
great writer—“A travers les orages et les ténèbres
de la guerre.” (<i>Guizot.</i>)</p>

<p>Let us bring the populations of Polynesia, of
Australia and China, of the Indies and of Africa,
nearer to Europe; let us make them participators
in the blessings of civilization.</p>

<p>To accomplish this great undertaking, we
appeal to all religious and intelligent men, for
it is worthy of their sympathy and co-operation.</p>

<p>We invoke the support of all statesmen, because
in the establishment of new and easy
means of communication between the two hemispheres
all nations are interested. Lastly,
we will address ourselves to the capitalists, when
they have satisfied themselves of the pecuniary
advantages to be derived from the undertaking.</p>

<h3>MEMORIAL ADDRESSED TO HIS HIGHNESS
MOHAMMED SAID,
VICEROY OF EGYPT.</h3>

<p class="right">The Camp, Marea, In the Lybian Desert,<br />
15th November, 1854.</p>

<p>The junction of the Mediterranean and the Red
Seas, by a navigable canal, is an undertaking
the utility of which has attracted the attention of all
the great men who have reigned in, or conquered,
Egypt: Sesostris, Alexander the Great, Julius Cæsar,
the Arab Conqueror Amrou, Napoleon I. and Mehemet
Ali.</p>

<p>A canal, communicating with the Nile, was in
existence in ancient times; first, for a period of 100
years, down to about the middle of the ninth century
before the Hegira; secondly, for a period of
445 years, from the reign of the first successors of
Alexander the Great, down to about the fourth century
before the Hegira; thirdly and lastly, for a
period of 130 years after the Arabian conquest.</p>

<p>Napoleon, upon his arrival in Egypt, immediately
organized a commission of engineers to ascertain
whether it would be possible to re-establish that ancient
channel of navigation: the question was resolved
in the affirmative, and when the learned M.
Lepère delivered to him the report of the commission,
on the eve of his return to France, he said: “It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
an important affair, it is not now in my power to
accomplish it, but the Turkish Government will
perhaps one day owe its preservation and its glory
to the execution of this project.”</p>

<p>The moment has now arrived to realize Napoleon’s
prediction. The work of cutting through the Isthmus
of Suez is certainly destined, more than any
other, to contribute to the preservation of the Ottoman
Empire, and to demonstrate to those who have
been wont to proclaim its decay and ruin, that it still
has a productive existence, and that it is capable of
adding a brilliant page to the history of the world’s
civilization.</p>

<p>Why have the governments and the peoples of
the West combined to uphold the Sultan in the possession
of Constantinople, and why has he who has
thought fit to menace that position met with the
armed opposition of Europe? Because the passage
from the Mediterranean into the Black Sea is of so
much importance, that whatever European Power
might become master of it would domineer over all
the rest, and destroy that balance which the whole
world is interested in preserving.</p>

<p>Do but establish at another point of the Ottoman
Empire a similar, and a yet more important position;
do but make Egypt the highway of the commercial
world by cutting through the Isthmus of Suez; and
thereby you will create in the East another immoveable
seat of power; for, as far as the new passage is
concerned, the great powers of Europe, from fear of
seeing it one day seized upon by one amongst them,
will regard the necessity of guaranteeing its neutrality,
as a question of vital importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Lepère fifty years ago required 10,000 workmen,
four years’ labour, and from 30 to 40,000,000
francs for the construction of the Suez Canal, but
upon a plan which would now be insufficient for the
demands of commerce and navigation; and his idea
was the possibility of a direct cutting through the
Isthmus towards the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Prior to the year 1840, some skilful English Engineers,
who were employed in levelling operations
in the Isthmus, had the honour of first ascertaining
that no difference existed between the levels of low
water in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of
Arabia.</p>

<p>M. Paulin Talabot, one of the three distinguished
Engineers chosen in 1847 by a society for the investigation
of the Isthmus of Suez,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (and who also
had important operations in levelling executed by
M. Bourdaloue,) had adopted the indirect route
from Alexandria to Suez: availing himself of the
barrage for the passage of the Nile, he estimated
the entire cost at 130,000,000 francs for the Canal,
and 20,000,000 for the port and roadstead of Suez.</p>

<p>M. Linant <i>Bey</i>, who for the last thirty years has
ably conducted canal works in Egypt, has made the
question of the Canal of the <i>two Seas</i> the study of
his life on the spot itself. He was appointed in
1853 to direct fresh levelling operations, and has
proposed to cut through the Isthmus in an almost
direct line at its narrowest part, establishing a large
inland port in the basin of Lake <i>Timsah</i>, and making
the channels from Pelusium, and from Suez,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
into the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, available
for the largest vessels.</p>

<p>The General of engineers, Gallice <i>Bey</i>, on his
part, submitted to Mehemet Ali a proposal for a
direct cutting across the Isthmus. M. Mougel <i>Bey</i>,
director of the Nile barrage-works, and chief engineer
of bridges and highways, also submitted to
Mehemet Ali the possibility and utility of cutting
through the Isthmus of Suez; and, in 1840, at the
request of Count Walewsky, at that time an envoy
in Egypt, he was instructed to take preliminary
measures which political events did not allow to be
carried out.</p>

<p>A thorough examination will decide which of the
lines is most suitable; and, as the undertaking has
been acknowledged to be practicable, it only remains
to make a choice. Whatever the operations that
may be necessary, and however difficult, they will
not intimidate modern art; their success can be no
matter of doubt at the present time: it is a question
of money, which the spirit of enterprise and association
will not fail to resolve, provided the benefits
resulting from it are in proportion to the outlay.</p>

<p>It is easy to demonstrate that the cost of the Canal
of Suez, admitting the highest estimate, is not out of
proportion with the utility and the profits of this
important work, which would curtail by more than
one-half the distance of India from the principal
countries of Europe and America. This result is
made obvious in the following Table, drawn up by
M. Cordier, professor of Geology:—</p>

<p>With such figures before us, comment is useless;
they show that all the nations of Europe, and even
the United States of America, are alike interested
in the opening of the canal of Suez, as well as in the
rigorous and inviolable neutrality of that thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Mohammed Saïd clearly comprehends that there
is no undertaking within his power, which, from its
immensity and the utility of its results, could bear
comparison with that which I propose to him. What
a splendid title to fame for him! What an everlasting
source of wealth for Egypt!</p>

<p>The pilgrimage to Mecca henceforth assured and
facilitated to all Mussulmans; an immense impulse
given to steam navigation and to distant voyages;
the countries on the coasts of the Red Sea and the
Gulf of Persia, the eastern coast of Africa, India,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the kingdom of Siam, Cochin China, Japan, the vast
empire of China, with its more than 300,000,000
of inhabitants, the Philippine Islands, Australia
and that immense Archipelago, towards which the
emigration from old Europe is directed, brought
nearer by nearly 3000 leagues to the Mediterranean
Sea and the north of Europe: such are the sudden
and immediate effects of cutting through the Isthmus
of Suez.</p>

<p>It has been calculated that the European and
American navigation, <i>viâ</i> the Cape of Good Hope
and <i>viâ</i> Cape Horn, may carry on a yearly traffic of
6,000,000 tons, and that on the half only of that
tonnage the world’s commerce would realize a benefit
of 150,000,000 francs annually, by sending the ships
<i>viâ</i> the Gulf of Arabia.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the canal of Suez will
occasion a considerable increase of tonnage; but in
reckoning only upon 3,000,000 tons, there will yet
be an annual produce of 30,000,000 francs by collecting
dues of ten francs per ton, which might be
reduced in proportion to the increase of navigation.</p>

<p>After having indicated the financial advantages
of the undertaking, let us consider its general political
advantages, which we believe to be equally
incontestable.</p>

<p>Everything that results in contributing to the extension
of the commerce, of the industry, and of the
navigation of the world, is especially advantageous
to England, a power which stands foremost amongst
all others from the importance of its navy, from the
productions of its manufactories, and from its commercial
relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>A deplorable prejudice, based upon the political
antagonism which so long and so unhappily existed
between France and England, has alone accredited
the opinion that the opening of the canal of Suez,
so useful for the interests of civilization and of the
common weal, could damage those of England. The
alliance of the two nations which rank highest in
the scale of civilization, an alliance which has already
proved the possibility of solutions hitherto reckoned
impossible by vulgar tradition, will, amongst its
other numerous benefits, allow us to investigate with
impartiality this mighty question of the Canal of
Suez, to form an exact estimate of its influence upon
the prosperity of nations and to consider it heresy
to believe, that an undertaking calculated to halve
the distance between the Western and Eastern hemispheres
of the globe, should not be suitable for
Great Britain, the mistress of Gibraltar, Malta, the
Ionian Islands, Aden, important stations on the east
coast of Africa, India, Singapore, and Australia.</p>

<p>England, as well as France, and even more so,
must wish to see a cutting through that strip of land
of thirty leagues, which no one who pays attention
to the subject of civilization and progress can behold
upon the map, without feeling the most ardent wish
for the disappearance of that only obstacle that Providence
has left in the highway of the world’s traffic.</p>

<p>The railway, by itself, is not sufficient; it will
never acquire any substantial importance, and will
only be assured of its revenues when it has become
the auxiliary of the maritime Canal of Suez. The
completion of the railway, so useful to travellers,
and so justly desired by England, will then become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a necessity, and will no longer be a heavy charge
upon the Egyptian Government.</p>

<p>Germany will also hail all the efforts for the construction
of the Canal across the Isthmus. It will
be to her the complement to the free navigation of
the Danube. Prince Metternich, who for more
than twenty years has interested himself in the cutting
of the Canal of the two Seas, and Baron de
Bruck, one of the promoters of the investigations
made in 1847, saw that in this question lay the aggrandizement
of Trieste and of Venice, as well as the
opening of important outlets for the produce of the
Imperial provinces, and of the kingdom of Hungary,
where the projected canal from the Danube to Kustendje,
on the Black Sea, in the line of the ancient
trench or rampart of Trajan, will facilitate exportation.</p>

<p>Russia will find in the opening of the Canal of
Suez a just satisfaction of that national aspiration
towards the East which led her on one occasion to
extend the limits of her vast Empire to the confines
of British India, and, on another, to threaten the
integrity of Turkey. The mission of civilization
devolving upon the Czar over the numerous tribes
of whom he is arbiter, may yet suffice the noblest
ambition; the new outlets which will be pacifically
thrown open to their activity and to their necessity
of expansion, will be more profitable to them than
a policy of conquest and exclusive dominion which
it is now no longer possible for any one nation to
carry on triumphantly.</p>

<p>The United States of America, whose traffic with
Indo-China and Australia has for many years immensely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
developed itself; Spain with the Philippine
Islands; Holland with Java, Sumatra and Borneo;
the towns formerly so flourishing on the coasts of
Italy; the ports and islands of Greece; all the nations
in short which have held or hold a high maritime
and commercial position; will hasten to take part in
a work which will augment their wealth, or create
new sources of it, and to the success of which I believe
I can promise His Highness Mohammed Saïd
the active and energetic co-operation of the enlightened
men of all countries.</p>

<h3>FIRMAN OF CONCESSION.</h3>

<p>Our friend Mons. Ferdinand de Lesseps, having
called our attention to the advantages which
would result to Egypt from the junction of the Mediterranean
and Red Seas, by a navigable passage for
large vessels, and having given us to understand the
possibility of forming a company for this purpose
composed of capitalists of all nations; we have accepted
the arrangements which he has submitted to
us, and by these presents grant him exclusive power
for the establishment and direction of a Universal
Company, for cutting through the Isthmus of Suez,
and the construction of a canal between the two Seas,
with authority to undertake or cause to be undertaken
all the necessary works and erections, on condition
that the Company shall previously indemnify
all private persons in case of dispossession for the
public benefit. And all within the limits, upon the
conditions and under the responsibilities, settled in
the following Articles.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article I.</span></h4>

<p>Mons. Ferdinand de Lesseps shall form a company,
the direction of which we confide to him, under
the name of the <span class="smcap">Universal Suez Maritime
Canal Company</span>, for cutting through the Isthmus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of Suez, the construction of a passage suitable for
extensive navigation, the foundation or appropriation
of two sufficient entrances, one from the Mediterranean
and the other from the Red Sea, and the
establishment of one or two ports.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article II.</span></h4>

<p>The Director of the Company shall be always appointed
by the Egyptian Government, and selected,
as far as practicable, from the shareholders most interested
in the undertaking.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article III.</span></h4>

<p>The term of the grant is ninety-nine years, commencing
from the day of the opening of the Canal
of the two Seas.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article IV.</span></h4>

<p>The works shall be executed at the sole cost of
the Company, and all the necessary land not belonging
to private persons shall be granted to it free of
cost. The fortifications which the Government shall
think proper to establish shall not be at the cost
of the Company.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article V.</span></h4>

<p>The Egyptian Government shall receive from the
Company annually fifteen per cent. of the net profits
shown by the balance sheet, without prejudice to the
interest and dividends accruing from the shares which
the Government reserves the right of taking upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
its own account at their issue, and without any
guarantee on its part either for the execution of the
works or for the operations of the Company; the remainder
of the net profits shall be divided as follows:—Seventy-five
per cent. to the benefit of the
Company, ten per cent. to the benefit of the members
instrumental to its foundation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article VI.</span></h4>

<p>The tariffs of dues for the passage of the Canal of
Suez, to be agreed upon between the Company and
the Viceroy of Egypt, and collected by the Company’s
agents, shall be always equal for all nations;
no particular advantage can ever be stipulated for
the exclusive benefit of any one country.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article VII.</span></h4>

<p>In case the Company should consider it necessary
to connect the Nile by a navigable cut with the
direct passage of the Isthmus, and in case the Maritime
Canal should follow an indirect course, the
Egyptian Government will give up to the Company
the uncultivated lands belonging to the public
domain, which shall be irrigated and cultivated at
the expense of the Company, or by its instrumentality.</p>

<p>The Company shall enjoy the said lands for ten
years free of taxes, commencing from the day of the
opening of the canal; during the remaining eighty-nine
years of the grant, the Company shall pay tithes
to the Egyptian Government, after which period it
cannot continue in possession of the lands above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
mentioned without paying to the said Government
an impost equal to that appointed for lands of the
same description.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article VIII.</span></h4>

<p>To avoid all difficulty on the subject of the lands
which are to be given up to the Company, a plan
drawn by M. Linant <i>Bey</i>, our Engineer Commissioner
attached to the Company, shall indicate the
lands granted both for the line and the establishments
of the maritime Canal and for the alimentary Canal
from the Nile, as well as for the purpose of cultivation,
conformably to the stipulations of Article VII.</p>

<p>It is moreover understood, that all speculation is
forbidden from the present time, upon the lands to
be granted from the public domain, and that the
lands previously belonging to private persons and
which the proprietors may hereafter wish to have
irrigated by the waters of the alimentary Canal,
made at the cost of the Company, shall pay a rent
of.... per <i>feddan</i> cultivated (or a rent amicably
settled between the Government and the Company).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article IX.</span></h4>

<p>The Company is farther allowed to extract from
the mines and quarries belonging to the public domain,
any materials necessary for the works of the
canal and the erections connected therewith, without
paying dues; it shall also enjoy the right of free
entry for all machines and materials which it shall
import from abroad for the purposes of carrying out
this grant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article X.</span></h4>

<p>At the expiration of the grant the Egyptian Government
will take the place of the Company, and
enjoy all its rights without reservation, the said Government
will enter into full possession of the Canal
of the two Seas, and of all the establishments connected
therewith. The indemnity to be allowed the
Company for the relinquishment of its plant and
moveables, shall be arranged by amicable agreement
or by arbitration.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XI.</span></h4>

<p>The statutes of the Society shall be moreover submitted
to us by the Director of the Company, and
must have the sanction of our approbation. Any
modifications that may be hereafter introduced must
previously receive our sanction. The said statutes
shall set forth the names of the founders, the list of
whom we reserve to ourselves the right of approving.
This list shall include those persons whose labours,
studies, exertions or capital have previously contributed
to the execution of the grand undertaking of
the Canal of Suez.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XII.</span></h4>

<p>Finally, we promise our true and hearty co-operation,
and that of all the functionaries of Egypt in
facilitating the execution and carrying out of the
present powers.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>For the Scheme of a Maritime Canal from the
Red Sea to the Mediterranean, and an Alimentary
Canal derived from the Nile.</i></span></h3>

<p class="right">Cairo, January 15, 1855.</p>

<p>Having just finished the exploration confided
to us by his Highness Mohammed Saïd Pacha,
I think it right to direct the attention of MM. Linant
<i>Bey</i> and Mougel <i>Bey</i> to the principal points
intended to serve as a programme to the precursory
scheme which we have agreed to present, as a preliminary
to a more complete report, accompanied by
plans, maps, sections, estimates, and other documents
in explanation.</p>

<p>1. For the entrance on the Red Sea side; to show
what works it will be necessary to execute, as jetties,
reservoirs, sluices, &amp;c. if the present port is made
use of. To settle the direction of the channel from
the present anchorage of the roads of Suez, to the
entrance of the Canal.</p>

<p>2. To show the exact direction of the Canal from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Suez, to that part of the ancient basin of the Red Sea
called the <i>Bitter Lakes</i>.</p>

<p>3. To explain how it is intended to take advantage
of this basin, and whether, in passing through
it, the Maritime Canal is to have one or two banks,
or not to have any at all.</p>

<p>4. To lay down the continuation of the Canal as
far as the basin of Lake Timsah, which is intended
to serve as an inland port.</p>

<p>5. Works to be performed in rendering Lake
Timsah fit for the object proposed. To give the
length of the quay walls. In its passage through
Lake Timsah, the Canal must be excavated of a
greater breadth than in the rest of its course, in
order to allow the vessels to lay at the quays without
obstructing the passage. These quays are to be
established, as far as possible, in the neighbourhood
of the fresh water canal.</p>

<p>6. Course of the Maritime Canal from Lake Timsah
to Lake Menzaleh.</p>

<p>7. The works to be executed along Lake Menzaleh,
or in the lake itself, for the course of the
Canal.</p>

<p>8. Is the opening of the Canal into the Mediterranean
to be at the opening of the ancient Pelusiac
branch?</p>

<p>9. To specify particularly the kind, nature, and
dimensions of the works that will have to be executed
in jetties, moles, breakwaters, reservoirs, retaining
basins, &amp;c. in order to obviate the objections made
up to the present time, as to the difficulties or
alleged impossibilities, proceeding from alluvial deposits
on the coast, and the choking up of the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of a Canal into the Mediterranean. This part of
the scheme must be based upon incontestable proofs,
exemplifications, and calculations.</p>

<p>10. What is the bulk of water that will enter the
Maritime Canal from the Red Sea at each tide?</p>

<p>11. What advantage may be derived from the
height of the tides, both in the course of the Maritime
Canal, in the basin of the Bitter Lakes, and at
the Pelusiac mouth?</p>

<p>12. To calculate for the Maritime Canal at a
breadth of 100 <i>metres</i> at the level of low water in
the Mediterranean, with liberty to reduce it to sixty-five
or seventy <i>metres</i>, in those few instances where
the necessary excavations and removals would be
too considerable. The water line, or depth, is to
be calculated at six, at seven, and at eight <i>metres</i>,
all below the level of low water in the Mediterranean,
in order that the Company may choose,
according to the expense, that one of the three depths
which shall be most advantageous to its interests,
combined with those of the navigation.</p>

<p>13. To obviate the objections relative to the difficulties
of navigation in the Red Sea and in the Gulf
of Pelusium.</p>

<p>14. To make a rough estimate of the <i>maximum</i>
of all the expenses, and to state the probable date
when the Canal can be opened for navigation.</p>

<p>15. To accompany the scheme of the Maritime
Canal, with a scheme for a Canal of communication,
of alimentation, and irrigation derived from the
Nile, taking its point of departure between the
barrage and Boulak, to reach the <i>Wady</i>, and come
as far as Lake Timsah. The dimensions shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
so calculated, that, taking into account its fall and
its supply, the Canal may water at least 100,000
feddans at the time of the inundation, and from
20 to 30,000 during the low water of the river.
In the vicinity of Lake Timsah, with which it will
communicate, this Canal is to be divided into two
branches, for simple irrigation; the first to be directed
towards Suez, the other towards Pelusium.</p>

<p>16. To examine whether the sands of the downs
on the Isthmus, will occasion any obstacle to the construction
and maintenance of the Canal, and how
they may be turned to account by means of the
Irrigating Canal.</p>

<p>17. To furnish a <i>maximum</i> estimate of the secondary
Canal derived from the Nile, and to state
the length of time required for the works.</p>

<p>18. To give an account of the nature and quality
of the materials, which can be easily, and without
great cost of transport, applied in the whole of the
works, and also the localities from whence they are
to be obtained.</p>

<p>19. Finally, to furnish an approximate statement
of the <i>minimum</i> anticipated revenues, of the grand
Maritime Canal, and of the Canal of alimentation
and interior navigation.</p>

<p>I do not mean to confine the labours of MM. Linant
<i>Bey</i> and Mougel <i>Bey</i>, within the mere limits
indicated in this programme.</p>

<p>While bearing witness to the good understanding
that I have observed to exist between them, and the
identity of their convictions, as to the possibility of
the communication between the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean, by a Canal accessible to large vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
I beg them, in case the opinion of either, upon any
question whatever, should not be entertained by the
other, to state the difference of their views, and to
assign the reasons thereof.</p>

<p>Finally, the precursory scheme, accompanied by
an explanatory map, is to be finished as quickly as
possible.</p>

<span class="smaller">By way of Precursory Scheme for cutting through
the Isthmus of Suez, by a direct Maritime Canal
from Pelusium to Suez.</span></h3>

<p>The enlightened Prince who now governs Egypt,
Mohammed Saïd Pacha, wishing to withdraw
the question of cutting through the Isthmus of Suez
from the uncertainties of theory, and to bring it into
practical reality, has granted a firman by which he
concedes to the Universal Company formed by the
capitalists of all countries, who are freely willing to
take part in the undertaking, the construction and
working of a Maritime Canal between the Red Sea
and the Mediterranean, with an additional Canal
for communication and irrigation, derived from the
Nile.</p>

<p>Dictating himself the terms of the Firman of Concession,
Prince Mohammed Saïd has required that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the undertaking shall be complete, and that an attentive
examination of the localities be made, in
order to profit by all the advantages offered by nature.
He has recommended that the shortest track be followed,
the least expensive, and that which will admit
of the largest ships. His early studies and his experience
in nautical art, have perfectly prepared him
for the comprehension of all the bearings of the
scientific question. He has indicated Pelusium and
Suez, as the extreme points of the cutting to be made
in that narrow tract of land, which presents a longitudinal
depression across the Isthmus, of thirty
leagues, and which is formed by the meeting of the
two plains descending with a gradual slope, the one
from Egypt, the other from the frontier hills of Asia.
He considers that nature has herself traced out the
communication between the two Seas, in the line of
this depression.</p>

<p>Towards Lake Timsah, situated at an equal distance
from Suez and Pelusium, another not less remarkable
furrow meets the longitudinal depression
at right angles; it is that of the <i>Wady Tomilat</i>
(the fruitful land of Goshen of Scripture). This furrow
still receives, for a considerable length, the
overflowings of the Nile, and also appears to form
the natural track of a canal of communication, commencing
at the river and proceeding to connect
itself in the central part of the Isthmus, with the grand
line of navigation to be established between the Arabian
Gulf and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The Maritime Canal will thus be brought into
communication with the heart of Egypt, by a fresh
water canal, which will receive the same navigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
as the Nile, and will serve also for the irrigation of
large zones of the desert, exhibiting at present the
most wild and desolate aspect.</p>

<p>Upon these data we have been instructed to make
a preliminary report.</p>

<p>Before giving the results of our investigations, it
has appeared necessary to us to justify the idea of
a direct track between the two Seas; for this line
never having been executed, although it is the most
natural, it might be supposed that whenever the
junction of the two Seas has been attempted, such
difficulties have been met with, that it has been obliged
to be relinquished; but this is by no means
the case, as we shall presently show.</p>

<p>In fact, what M. Lebeau says in his <i>Histoire du
Bas Empire</i> (tom, xii., p. 490), following Abulfeda,
Prince of Syria, historian and geographer, who was
living in the year 753 of the Hegira, is as follows:—</p>

<p>“The coast at Farma (a town a little to the east
of Pelusium, on the Mediterranean) was only
seventy miles (106,000 <i>metres</i>) distant from the
Red Sea. This space was a very smooth plain,
slightly elevated above the level of the two Seas.
Amrou formed the design of uniting them by a
canal, which he would have filled with the waters
of the Nile; but Omar having opposed it, from
fear of opening an entrance into Arabia for the
ships of the Christians, Amrou turned his thoughts
in another direction. There was an ancient canal,
called Trajanus Amnis, which Adrian caused to be
brought from the Nile near to Babylon, in Egypt,
as far as Pharboëtus, now Belbeïs. He met at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
this place with another canal, commenced by
Nechos, and continued by Darius Hystaspes, and
the two together discharged themselves into a lagoon
of salt water, at the outlet of which Ptolemy
Philadelphus caused a large trench to be made,
which conducted the waters as far as the town of
Arsinoë, or Cleopatris, at that part of the Gulf
where Suez now is.</p>

<p>“The whole of this canal, being filled up with
sand, had become useless at the time of the famous
Cleopatra. Amrou was not deterred by the ancient
prejudice, which, supposing the waters of
the Red Sea to be higher than the soil of Egypt,
created a fear of opening a passage for them; and
he made it navigable for the transport of the corn
of Egypt into Arabia. It is that which is now
called Khalig, which passes through Cairo, but it
only goes as far as the lagoon called the Lake of
Sheib. The remainder, as far as the Red Sea, is
entirely filled up, although some traces of it are
still distinguishable.”</p>

<p>We have thought it necessary to quote the entire
passage, because it clearly establishes the question
of the Canal, and certain facts to which we shall
return hereafter.</p>

<p>After Amrou came the Sultan, Mustapha III.,
<i>who took great interest in the scheme for the junction
of the two Seas by the Isthmus of Suez</i>, and
who intended to execute this work at a time of
peace. (See <i>Mémoires sur les Turcs</i>, by M. De
Tott, Parts iii. and iv.)</p>

<p>M. Lepère proposed, it is true, the track of the
secondary canal between Alexandria and the interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of Egypt; but his opinion upon the direct track
by the Isthmus of Suez is expressed in these terms:—</p>

<p>“In this project of the Canal of Suez, we have
expressly based the choice of the ancient direction
by the interior of the Delta towards Alexandria,
upon commercial considerations peculiar to Egypt,
and upon the fact that the coast near Pelusium
does not appear to allow of a permanent maritime
establishment. Nevertheless, we think it right
to acknowledge, that, waving these considerations,
it would still be easy (although, on the contrary,
it appeared difficult, and even dangerous, before
the invention of locks) to open a direct communication
between Suez, the Bitter Lakes, and the
Ras-el-Moyeh, continued upon the eastern bank
of Lake Menzaleh, as far as the sea near Pelusium.</p>

<p>“We think that a canal opened in this direction
would have an advantage <i>which the interior canal
would not</i>. In fact there might be constant navigation
upon it, which would not be subject to the
alternations of the rising and decreasing of the Nile.
It would be easy to maintain a greater depth in it
than in the first canal, by means of a current fed
by the immense reservoir of the Bitter Lakes....
I will add, that if I did not perceive
some difficulties in excavating, and maintaining at
a proper depth, the channel between Suez and the
roadstead, I would propose to establish a direct
communication of the two Seas by the Isthmus, for
the use of corvettes and even of frigates, which
would become the complement of this grand and
important operation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen then, that M. Lepère himself acknowledged,
that the direct track was the most advantageous
for the commerce of the world, while the
interior Canal was especially advantageous to Egypt.
It is evident that with the two Canals, the one direct,
on a large section, the other on a small section and
derived from the Nile, all interests are most abundantly
satisfied.</p>

<p>We will finish these observations by quoting the
opinion of two distinguished staff-officers, MM. Galinier
and Ferret, who have surveyed and well investigated
the Red Sea. They have given a clear, rapid,
and judicious analysis of the question.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not in the accomplishment of this project
(the interior canal), that the real junction of the
two Seas consists. This problem will not be resolved,
until the Isthmus shall present a practicable
opening, by which all ships may pass without unloading.
In order to this, it must be operated
upon directly from Pelusium to Suez; on this line
the desert is narrower than anywhere else. It is
also in this direction, that the great depression of
which we have spoken extends, and at the bottom
of which the grand basin of the Bitter Lakes is
situated. Everything therefore points out this
spot in the strip of land for the construction of a
canal. Everything, with one single exception,
which is, that there is not, they say, any port at
the extremity of this line of navigation; that of
Suez is partly filled up with sand, and upon the
Mediterranean, not a harbour, not a single roadstead,
which now affords any safety. Yet more,
some travellers have stated, that if it were required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to form a port, it would be necessary to contend
against masses of sand, which, continually shifted
from west to east by a tolerably rapid current,
seem to oppose any maritime establishment upon
that coast. In fact it is, they say, for this reason
that Alexander laid much farther to the west the
foundations of the town which bears his name, and
which he wished to become the emporium of the
world. But is the objection very serious at the
present time? can the obstacle, which occasions
this anxiety, resist the constructive means which
are at the disposal of our engineers? We think
not. To create a port without the assistance of
nature; to put a restraint upon the sea; to reduce
it to subjection; to impose upon it an artificial
roadstead; and to maintain that roadstead, in spite
of the natural causes operating to destroy it: is a
problem which has ceased to terrify modern art.</p>

<p>“Let us take the port of Pelusium,—see how
easily the difficulty would be removed! Suppose
the Bitter Lakes to be filled with the waters of the
Arabian Gulf; by the action of the tides alone,
more than 700,000,000 cubic <i>metres</i> of water
might be turned to account, the velocity of which
would constantly scour the channel, and prevent
the accumulation of sand at its mouth.</p>

<p>“After all that has been done by printing, the
mariner’s compass, steam,—the nineteenth century,
by the realization of this vast undertaking,
would again change the face of the globe. But, not
to carry our views and our anticipations so far, in
a zone nearer at hand, Arabia and Abyssinia, the
vast country of the Gallas, the deserts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
western coast of the Red Sea, with their roving
populations, attached by powerful ties to the vast
circle of traffic which our continent unceasingly
creates and feeds—will enter into the pale of the
European world. Navigation and industry charged
with the supply of immense countries destitute of
everything, will take a more extensive range. In
the wake of commerce, enlightenment and civilization
will penetrate, by degrees, that dreary night
which envelopes the Mussulman world.”</p>

</div>

<p>The advantage of the new track being thus sufficiently
proved from a general point of view, we shall
now enter into the details of the scheme with regard
to its execution. We will begin with the levelling
of the line from Pelusium to Suez. These levels
were taken by some engineers attached to the French
expedition, and the difference between the level of
high water at Suez, and of low water at Tineh, was
found to be 9 <i>met.</i>, 90, in favour of the Red Sea.
Although this result has been explained by geological
and historical considerations, the fact appeared so
extraordinary that several travellers came to the
spot to verify it. Some English officers amongst
others, operating first with the barometer, and afterwards
with the boiling water process, were not able
to discover any perceptible difference between the
levels of the two Seas. These investigations, published
in a pamphlet which has come before us, and
which were known to the learned world, had occasioned
much uncertainty, when, in 1847, a society
established for the investigation of the Isthmus of
Suez, and at the head of which were MM. Négrelli,
Robert Stephenson and Talabot, caused a complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
survey to be made by French engineers, under the
direction of M. Bourdaloue, well known for his
improved methods of levelling, and his numerous
labours in that particular branch. These able and
experienced surveyors, provided with good instruments,
and accompanied by a numerous staff, were
formed into several divisions, which operated separately,
and thus were able to obtain divers verifications.</p>

<p>To give still greater facility and more security to
the operations of the engineers, His Highness the
viceroy, who had generously provided for all the requirements
of the expedition, condescended to make
choice of one of us to direct the whole of the operations,
with the assistance of a brigade of Egyptian
Engineers and a Company of artillerymen, who
assisted in all the operations of levelling and verification.</p>

<p>M. Talabot, the engineer, in a report published
in 1847, has entered into all the details of these operations,
and has given an irrefutable proof of the
results obtained. As these results differed very
widely from those obtained by the engineers of the
French expedition, it was difficult to believe in so
great an error.</p>

<p>M. Sabatier, Consul General of France in Egypt,
having been informed of the wish of some learned
Frenchmen to have a fresh verification, spontaneously
applied to the viceroy of Egypt, and one of us
was appointed to undertake it in consequence.</p>

<p>The verification was made in 1853. It resulted
in favour of the surveyors of 1847. For, the new
levels only differ 0 <i>met.</i>, 1814, from those of 1847,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and give as the difference of level between the station
on the quay of the hotel at Suez, and low water in
the Mediterranean 2 <i>met.</i>, 4286, instead of 2 <i>met.</i>,
6100 found by the operations in 1847.</p>

<p>There cannot be a moment’s hesitation in making
choice between the levellings of 1799 and those of
1847 and 1853, for the two latter were taken under
the most favourable circumstances by experienced surveyors
provided with the best instruments, and were
verified several times without finding any perceptible
difference by these various verifications; whilst
the levelling of 1799 was undertaken in the midst
of the vicissitudes and dangers of warfare, in a hostile
country, and in a climate to which the engineers
were not accustomed. One part of the operations
was performed with the spirit level; another rather
important portion could only be done with the water
level; the surveyors frequently differed; none of the
divisions of these levellings could be verified; and
if the last operations had been retarded ever so little,
the incidents of the war would have made them impossible;
the operations had to be performed with
rapidity, and the levels taken in long lengths; with
frequent interruptions, and without the check of any
verification. This is what M. Lepère has stated in
his memorial, where he expresses himself thus:—</p>

<p>“Pressed for time, disturbed by the hostile demonstrations
of the Arab tribes, frequently obliged
to suspend operations, obliged in fine to take a
great part of the observations with a water level,
with no possibility of making any verification, it
is not at all surprising that the able engineers who
conducted these operations under such exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
circumstances should have arrived at uncertain
results.” We have therefore adopted the levels
taken in 1847 and in 1853, as the only true ones,
the only ones that were verified, and the only satisfactory
ones. We give an abstract of them in the
following table:—</p>

<p>The most striking fact to be observed in the examination
of this table is, the slight relief of the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
above high water of the Red Sea, in the whole extent
of the Isthmus. There are only two points
somewhat elevated. The first, proceeding from Suez,
is met with before Lake Timsah, and is that which
we shall call the Serapeum bar; its greatest elevation
is 16 <i>met.</i>, 5950, above low water in the Mediterranean.
The second point is at the outlet of the
lake, and its greatest elevation is fifteen <i>metres</i>, at
the spot known as the bar of <i>El Guisr</i>; but the line
of the Canal may be carried in a direction where
but ten <i>metres</i> are met with for some <i>kilometres</i> of
length. Supposing therefore the bed of the canal
to be established at the depth of 6 <i>met.</i>, 50, below
low water in the Mediterranean, the greatest excavation
would be at the bar of <i>El Guisr</i>, and would
show a total depth of 16 <i>met.</i>, 50, which is nothing
extraordinary; supposing it even twenty <i>metres</i>, the
requisite excavation would bear no comparison with
what was executed in Mexico, during the Spanish
occupation. For, in their then difficult position, and
in the absence of tools and improved means, the
Spaniards were able to effect, near the town of Mexico,
which was threatened with invasion by the waters
of the neighbouring lakes, the cutting of Huehuetoca,
the total length of which is 20,585 <i>metres</i>,
and its depth from forty-five to sixty <i>metres</i>, for a
length of more than 800 <i>metres</i>, and from thirty to
fifty <i>metres</i> for a length of 3500 <i>metres</i>. And yet
the expense of this work was only 31,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>The levelling also shows, that by adopting 6 <i>met.</i>,
50, for the bed of the Canal, there will be a length of
18 <i>kil.</i> in the Bitter Lakes, where there will not be
a shovelful to remove, and for another 18 <i>kil.</i> there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
will be very little to do; and as these lakes are dry at
a depth of 8 <i>met.</i>, 39, below low water, all the earth-works
for the whole length of them could be performed
in the dry, if found advantageous to do so.</p>

<p>The numerous transverse sections taken with the
levelling of 1847, enable us to ascertain approximately
the superfice of the Bitter Lakes at the water
line. This superfice is about 330,000,000 <i>square
metres</i>. If, then, the action of the tide, which brings
two <i>metres</i> of moving water, be admitted into these
lakes, a disposable volume of 660,000,000 <i>cubic
metres</i> of water would be accumulated, and which
might be raised to 800,000,000 by adding Lake
Timsah and the retaining basins at Suez and Pelusium
to these immense reservoirs.</p>

<p>Before pointing out the various directions of the
adopted track, it appears necessary to arrive at a
fixed opinion as to the formation of the Isthmus and
of the downs by which it is partly covered, and also
as to the accumulations of sand which exist both on
the coast of Pelusium and at the bottom of the Gulf
of Suez; for it is from the explanation of these phenomena
that we shall start in our justification of the
arrangements of the direct track in general and in
detail.</p>

<p>By attentively observing what is passing before
our eyes at the present time, in respect of the destruction
and recomposition of continuity, we may
come to an exact conclusion regarding the laws
which operated towards the first ages of the world
in the formation of alluvial lands.</p>

<p>Let us first examine what is going on in the
English Channel; for this narrow sea having a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
number of ports both on the French and English
coasts, has on that account been the object of numerous
observations by engineers.</p>

<p>The first well recognised fact is the destruction
of the coast from the point of Barfleur as far as
the Somme, a distance of 338 <i>kilometres</i>; and on
the other side of the channel, from the Isle of
Wight to Dover, a distance of 250 <i>kilometres</i>.
This action is produced by the alternation of frost
and thaw, by dry and moist winds, and by the
saline evaporation of the sea. The abrasion observed
on the coast of Calvados is an average of
0 <i>met.</i>, 25, <i>per ann.</i> and on the coasts of Normandy
and England 0 <i>met.</i>, 30. The mean height of the
cliffs on either side being sixty <i>metres</i>, it follows that
the channel swallows up an amount of 10,000,000
<i>cubic metres</i> of earth and stones every year, which
must find a place somewhere.</p>

<p>The second fact, equally well established, and
which, though opposed to the opinion of the ancients,
can no longer leave any doubt on the mind,
is, that rivers, with a few rare exceptions,—such as
the Loire for instance,—only carry to the sea an
extremely thin mud, destined to be lost in the mass
of matter held in suspension by the latter; that the
sands of rivers do not in general reach the sea, and
that the muddy or sandy deposits observed in tidal
rivers, are entirely owing to the matters brought by
the tide. This discovery has been arrived at as
follows.</p>

<p>In making the analysis of the alluvial lands forming
the Bay of St. Michael, it was found that the
principal substances of their formation are silex and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the carbonate of lime; that the nearer the sea is
approached, the more the proportion of silex increases;
the more it is receded from, the more considerable
the proportion of carbonate of lime becomes.
Now if the basins of the three rivers which
discharge themselves into this bay, the Sée, the
Selime and the Couësnon, be examined, they will
be found entirely destitute of calcareous substances.
It is the same with the coasts of the channel and of
Brittany. It cannot, therefore, be either from these
rivers or from the coasts that the enormous proportion
of silex proceeds which has just been described.
If samples are examined with a magnifying glass,
commencing with those nearest the sea, and afterwards
proceeding farther into the bay, in the first,
fragments of shells are perceived quite distinguishable,
then these fragments are reduced and become
so impalpable, that the best glass will no longer
enable us to distinguish the form in the most calcareous
portions.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, certain that the calcareous part
comes exclusively from the sea, and even from
the bottom of the roadstead of Cancale. As for
the silex and clay, a part in their deposit may be
attributed to the rivers; but it should first be understood
how unimportant these three small rivers
are, each discharging not more than an average of
eight to ten <i>cubic metres</i> of water per second. Farther,
if the contributions of the rivers reckoned for
anything in the deposits which are made in this
locality, clayey or gravelly stratifications would be
seen on their banks at the parts where the tide is
least felt. Nothing of the kind occurs. The mixture
of the calcareous matter, the grains of silex,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and the argillaceous atoms is so intimate, that it is
evident it could only be made at the very centre of
the production of the calcareous matter; that is to
say, at the bottom of the sea. If the fluviatile deposit
was appreciable, it would counterbalance entirely,
or in part, the calcareous overplus in the
drift taken from the top of the roadstead, as compared
with that taken at the bottom. Far from this
being the case, the progression of the calcareous
element, which can only come from the sea, is seen
in proportion to the elevation of the shores. Finally,
if the fluviatile deposit ought to be reckoned for anything,
a larger proportion of clay would be seen
upon the brink of the Sée, which traverses fissile
lands, than in the neighbouring channel of the
Couësnon, which traverses lands of a much harder
character, furnishing less clay than the fissile ground
of the Sée and the Selime. Now, the contrary is
the case; the drifts of the neighbouring channel of
the Couësnon are more clayey than the others, solely
because this channel being more sheltered than the
beds of the other two rivers, the muddy matter
which the sea always holds so abundantly in suspension,
and which it deposits in the basins of ports,
can be carried there concurrently with the drifts.</p>

<p>On making the same investigations for the Seine,
it was found that the sands transported by this river
do not pass Rouen, and that all the accretions that
are seen lower down, as far as the flats which are
met with at its mouth, are deposits by the sea.</p>

<p>The same results were arrived at for the Scheld.</p>

<p>As to the Meuse and the Rhine, the following deductions
have been made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The abrasion of the coasts of the channel supplies
the sea with fragments of chalk and siliceous rocks,
which being rolled about by the sea become shingle.
This shingle forms banks along the English and
French coasts, and forced by the double action of
flood and wind towards the straits it approaches them;
but the shingle on the coast of France continually
decreasing in size, reaches the mouth of the Somme,
where it finds the point of Cayeux formed by its accumulation.
Stopped at this point by the waters of
the Somme, and by the change in the direction of
the current of the sea which turns towards the Pas
de Calais, this shingle increases the point of Cayeux,
so long as its continual collision has not sufficiently
reduced the size of the stones for them to be carried
away by the sea; but when they are small enough,
the flood bears them away and distributes them on
the numerous banks which are found between the
Somme and the Pas de Calais. From the inspection
of Marine Charts, it is seen that the fineness of the
deposit increases in proportion as these banks are
nearer to the straits, and if the banks disappear in
the Straits, it is because the force of the current does
not allow the sands, which from being sifted for a
long time have become finer and finer, to stop in that
passage. They pass it therefore and some go to
form the downs between Dunkirk and the Scheld,
others in like manner to form downs on the English
coast, others remaining in the strongest currents are
carried as far as the mouths of the Humber in England,
and of the Meuse and Rhine on the Continent.</p>

<p>If the shape of the English and French coasts to
the north and south of the Straits is observed attentively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
it will strike every one that those to the south
are cut out into concave indentations, while those
to the north all affect the convex form. It is because
the coasts to the south of the Straits are
abraded by the tide, and those to the north, on the
contrary, are fed by the accretions. As for the
muddy matters in this long course, they can only
be deposited in a few perfectly tranquil creeks, or
in the basins of open ports on either coast. Wherever
the tide penetrates they are carried with it,
and, when finally it has entered the northern sea,
and made a course sufficiently long to abate its
swiftness, it finds itself in an excellent condition for
depositing these muddy matters, which it holds in
suspension. This is what it does at the mouth of
the Humber, where it completely chokes up the port
of Hull.</p>

<p>In like manner, the muddy matters form at the
mouth of the Rhine, of the Meuse, and of the Scheld,
those immense polders, which constitute such an
essential part of the territory of Holland, and the
numerous banks at the mouth of these rivers are
only composed of sand and carbonate of lime. Now
the rapidity of the current, long before reaching
the mouth, is not sufficiently great to carry down
the sands; in fact, no trace of them is perceived;
these banks are therefore the production of the sea.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to appreciate at the <i>maximum</i>
the power of the fluviatile deposit in the formation
of the coasts, observations have been made upon the
Yssel, that branch of the Rhine which discharges
itself into the Zuyderzee. This sea has but very
feeble tides, 0 <i>met.</i>, 40, at ordinary high water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
very much resembles the Mediterranean, the Black
Sea, and the Adriatic Gulf in this respect. A muddy
Delta has also been formed at the mouth of the
Yssel, of the same shape as those of the Rhone, the
Po, the Nile, &amp;c. &amp;c. This Delta cannot be exclusively
owing to the Yssel, because, although it is
true that the tides of the Zuyderzee are very feeble,
on the other hand the shores which surround it are
of an exceedingly friable nature; now, however
feeble the tides may be, they yet attack the banks,
and what proves it, is, that the Hollanders are obliged
to defend them. By considering the Delta
of the Yssel as a fluviatile deposit solely, we shall
therefore have an extreme case. Now, this Delta
has a superfice of only 1500 <i>hectares</i>, while the
superfice of the land in Holland, which is evidently
of modern deposit, is at least 1,000,000 <i>hectares</i>.
If it is observed that the Yssel only emits a fifteenth
of the whole volume of the Rhine and the Meuse
united, it will give 22,500 <i>hectares</i> for the deposit
of the river, against 1,000,000 deposited by the sea;
which is scarcely two per cent. of what the sea has
furnished in the formation of the polders of Holland.</p>

<p>From the examination of all these facts, it evidently
results, as we have said, that in seas with
tides, the rivers not only do not form banks, alluvium,
or deltas at their mouths, but farther, that the
alluvium found in the regions of these rivers submitted
to the action of the tide, is deposited by
the sea.</p>

<p>We shall now prove that these conclusions are
equally true for the rivers of the Mediterranean,
notwithstanding the opinion of the Italian engineers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
who have considered the fluviatile origin of their
deltas as demonstrated.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the propagation of the waves
or billows of the sea agitated by the wind, they have
been compared to a field of corn under the action
of the air. It seems as if the ears of corn had
an impulsive swiftness, which however does not
exist, since they do not quit their places. Farther,
if the wind is feeble, it is only the ears which waver
without the stalks being shaken; but, in proportion
as the wind rises, the stalks take part in the movement
to a greater and greater depth down to the root.</p>

<p>The waves have been again compared to the
movements of a cord, which is made to undulate by
shaking one of its extremities in the hand. It seems
as if the cord was going at a rapid rate, while in
reality it does not quit the hand that shakes it, only
each point of it rises and falls alternately, and this
movement is the greater according as the impulse
is stronger; if the extremity of the cord opposite to
that which receives this impulse encounters an obstacle,
as the surface of a wall for instance, it will
strike it at each movement of the hand.</p>

<p>It is exactly the same with the waves of the sea;
every fluid molecule placed at the surface of the billow
experiences an oscillatory movement nearly
vertical, so that if a body floating on the surface of
a wave is watched it will be seen to remain in the
same place, sometimes in the hollow of the wave,
sometimes on its summit, and if at length it changes
its place, that depends upon other circumstances,
such as the force of the wind or the direction of the
currents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>This oscillatory movement which is perceived on
the surface of the sea, is necessarily developed to a
certain depth, which will be greater in proportion
as the undulations are stronger at the surface. This
fact has been confirmed by experiment; it has been
ascertained in effect that the agitation of the sea
caused by the wind, is communicated to a certain
depth, variable according to the wind, according to
the sea, and the places where the observations were
made, and that beyond that depth the sea is perfectly
calm. Thus it may be admitted as an observed and
well proved fact, that the waves require a certain
depth for their free developement; if an obstacle is
presented to this developement, there will be a forcible
re-action of the wave against this obstacle which
will be carried off, if it is moveable, and will enter
into the system of the wave. This action of the
waves against the deeps is what is called the <i>ground
swell</i>.</p>

<p>This established, it has already been seen that the
coast of the sea, as well as the projecting capes, resign
to the sea every year a certain amount of earthy
and rocky matters. These matters are removed by
the waves which break upon the shore, the soft portions
are quickly disintegrated by this powerful
action, and form muddy sand and mud, and the hard
portions are rounded into pebbles the size of which
is diminished more and more by the prolonged action
of the force which set them in motion and which reduces
them to sand; but in proportion as these matters
arrive at a sufficient degree of tenuity, they become
susceptible of submitting to the transporting
force of the waves and currents, and quit the place
where they were formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>This transporting force depends both upon the
height of the tides and the direction of the winds, as
well as their intensity, combined with that of the
currents which are observed in all seas. So that
while considerable masses of matter are set in motion
along the shores, the rivers, especially those which
traverse a great extent of country, transport as far
as their mouths only muddy matters, so light that they
are carried to a distance, and afterwards deposited
in the depths of the sea. This is remarkably the
case with the Nile, whose waters at the time of the
inundation are distinguished by their colour for more
than ten leagues into the sea. All the deposits and
accretions of the river up to 20 <i>kilom.</i> above its
mouth are muddy, while all the banks which are at
its mouth are composed of sand alone.</p>

<p>Thus, all the impediments of the mouth of the
Nile evidently emanate from the sea. To demonstrate
it by still farther evidence, we will repeat the
reasoning of the engineer M. Bonniceau relative to
the alluvium of the river Mersey, in his excellent
work upon the navigation of tidal rivers: “If the
deposits emanated from the elevated lands in a sensible
degree, the quantities deposited from time
to time ought to be proportional to the quantity
of rain that falls at the same epochs, because the
same amount of matters descending from the elevated
lands and transported by the river, ought to
be partly regulated by the quantity of water that
carries them; but it is a fact well ascertained, that
the accumulations of sand which exist in the vicinity
of the mouth are greater in proportion as the
waters of the river are less abundant, while on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
contrary at the time of the increase, when the Nile
contains nearly 0 <i>met.</i> 008 of matter in suspension,
the sand banks are removed and thrown back far
off into the sea.”</p>

<p>It is said that Alexander the Great was determined
in his choice of the situation for the port of
Alexandria by the consideration of the winds and
littoral currents which carry eastward the matters
held in suspension by the Nile, and thus cover the
coast with sand. If this theory were true, no alluvium
ought to be perceived westward of the mouth
of the river. Now all the coast from Tripoli as far
as El Aritch is covered with sand banks, which frequently
form downs, and these downs are found at
the present time transported several leagues into the
interior of the lands westward of the Rosetta mouth.</p>

<p>The port of Alexandria itself has not escaped the
action of the ground swell, for a sand bank has been
formed which occupies a good third of the total
superfice of the roadstead. Happily for the port the
accumulation of sand appears to have been arrested
long ago, or rather its increase has become imperceptible.</p>

<p>The roadstead of Alexandria owes its depth to the
disposition of its sides in respect to the winds and
currents. It is like the roadstead of Algiers, which
is everywhere very deep, while the neighbouring
ports have sand banks. It cannot be said that these
sand banks are owing to the presence of rivers, which
do not exist in the whole extent of the coast of Barbary,
for the few land streams that are scattered
along the shore cannot be called by that name.</p>

<p>We have seen that the winds and the currents carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the detritus of the coasts reduced to sand to great
distances. The currents however do not arrest the
motion of the waves and the ground swell; they
bend to their forms, and as their direction necessarily
tends to the shore, the sands clear the currents
with the ground swell which contains them,
and which thus conducts them to the shore. When
the direction of the waves is oblique to the coast,
the sands are borne to a distance, but when it is perpendicular
to the coast, the waves raise the sands
brought by the ground swell into dykes and banks,
which protect the low shores. The most minute
and lightest portions are accumulated at the more
elevated points of the flats, where, being dried by
the sun, they are soon carried away by the wind,
which leaves them, in its turn, in the shape of downs.
The ground swell, therefore, furnishes the materials
of those downs, which usually border flat shores,
and it is that which has drawn from the depths of
the sea the sands of those immense deserts of Africa,
and of so many other plains which are found in various
parts of the globe.</p>

<p>“Often,” says M. Jomard, “have I remained
for whole hours, contemplating the origin and
progress of the phenomenon of the formation of
sands. I saw the waves break and deposit a small
line, scarcely discernible, of very fine sand. Another
wave came, burdened like the first, and this
new line of sand pushed the first slightly on.
This, once beyond the reach of the water, and exposed
to the rays of a burning sun, was quickly
dried, and became the prey of the wind, which
immediately seized and carried it off into the air;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the less light particles of gravel did not reach so
far, but, subjected to the alternate motion, diminished
more and more, and were converted by
degrees into sand.”</p>

<p>We may also say with Colonel Emy, that</p>

<p>“All river bars are deposits, brought or arrested
by the ground swell, and without it these deposits
would be repelled into the main as far as the
rivers extend their course. The Delta of the Nile,
those of the Mississippi, of the Ganges, of the Scheld,
of the Meuse, of the Rhine, and the Camargue
of the Rhone, were originally bars formed by this
same ground swell.”</p>

<p>The tongues of sand which separate the lake of
Thau from the gulf of the Lion, the tongue of earth
upon which Alexandria is built, those which separate
the lakes Bourlos and Menzaleh from the Mediterranean,
are bars of sand formed by the ground
swell. The sand bank which separates from the
Red Sea the vast basin of the Bitter Lakes, was,
without any doubt, a ford elevated by the ground
swell, which, in tempestuous weather, ascends this
sea with the current of the tides charged with sand.
The ford, which answers at the present time at Suez,
was certainly formed in this manner by the ground
swell.</p>

<p>We may say also, that the whole Isthmus of Suez
was formed by the maritime deposits of the Mediterranean
and of the Red Sea. We believe that,
previous to historic times, the two Seas were in communication
with each other, that the detritus of the
chains of mountains situated to the right and left,
carried down by rain, filled up the space which separates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
them, and that when that space was elevated
to such a height that the ground swell could reach
it, its action was applied in such a way that by the
meeting of the swell of the two Seas, a bank was
formed, which is no other than the bar of El Guisr.
After the formation of this bank, the combined action
of the ground swell, both on one side and the
other, and the accretions from the neighbouring
mountains continued until the Isthmus was dry.
Then the soil thus constituted was covered by the
downs, which advanced upon it from the direction
of Pelusium, driven by the north winds, and from
the direction of Suez, driven by the winds and currents
from the south.</p>

<p>In this state the Isthmus is at present, and the
numerous soundings which we have asked for from
His Highness the Viceroy, will prove whether our
hypothesis is well founded or not.</p>

<p>The same theory may, as Colonel Emy observes
in his remarkable work, throw a new light on important
geological facts:—</p>

<p>“For instance, those ancient and elevated plains,
composed of sand and pebbles, the formation of
which, it has been attempted to explain, by the
revolutions of the globe and violent convulsions
of nature, or which have been regarded as deposits
left by rivers, appear to be maritime accretions.
If is, indeed, easy to conceive rivers capable of
bringing down the fragments detached from
mountains, by shocks, and by the decomposition
of the rocks; but how could they extend those
fragments uniformly, and over spaces so extensive
as the plains in question? Moreover, was not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
course from the summits of the mountains generally
too short for the fragments of the excessively
hard rock found in some of those plains, to have
time to acquire their roundness? The rivers have
prolonged their courses through these accumulations
of pebbles; they may, in overflowing, have
covered them with sand and earth, but it is more
probable that they contributed in nowise to the
formation of these accretions, unless it were by
transporting the rough materials to the sea. Nothing
but the ground swell could spread these
fragments of mountains so uniformly as they are,
convert them into shingle and sand by a long
trituration on the shores, where it had driven
them; gather them either into banks or plains,
and thus fill up spaces over which the sea formerly
extended.</p>

<p>“The ancient collections of shingle, pebbles and
sand are owing, like those at present forming
in a similar manner, to maritime accretions, and
must henceforth be regarded as an incontestable
proof that the ocean formerly reached and was
long stationary at different heights far exceeding
its present level.”</p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, to find on divers points
of the Isthmus pieces of hard stone broken into
small fragments, and half rounded, covering the
sand-banks at variable heights above the level of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>But, be it as it may, it is certain that throughout
the length of the line, from the roadstead of Suez to
that of Pelusium, the excavations will only be in
light earth, which can be easily removed by hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
as far as the water line, and with dredges down to
the bed of the Canal.</p>

<p>The track which we have followed for the Canal
was prescribed by the very nature of the locality,
and by the condition that the two Seas were to be
brought into direct communication in the most economical
manner.</p>

<p>The line begins at the roadstead of Suez, turns to
the east of the town, making a curve to reach
the ancient track, which it leaves to the west, and
follows the channel of the valley until it joins the
Bitter Lakes, which anciently formed the extremity
of the gulf of the Red Sea. It traverses those lakes
throughout their length, following their sinuosities,
so as to avoid the inequalities of the ground. On
leaving the lakes, the line crosses the bar of the
Serapeum, at its lowest point, and enters Lake Timsah,
leaving the heights of Cheik Ennedek to the
east.</p>

<p>The last-mentioned lake is to serve in the formation
of an inland port, in which ships may be revictualled
and repaired, while it will be the point of
junction between the Maritime Canal and the Canal
communicating with the Nile.</p>

<p>In traversing this lake, the line forms several
curves, in order to avoid the extensive downs which
have encroached upon a part of that region.</p>

<p>On leaving the lake, the line proceeds to the bar
of El Guisr, at its lowest point, and then goes towards
Lake Menzaleh, which it follows directly along
its eastern shore as far as Pelusium, and is prolonged
into the sea until it reaches a depth of 7
<i>m.</i>, 50.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The dimensions of the Canal have been determined
by the idea of creating a grand passage for
maritime navigation, open to steam and sailing vessels
of considerable burthen. The Caledonian Canal
is the only known analogous work. This Canal,
however, is but 37 <i>m.</i> broad at the water line, and
but 6 <i>m.</i>, 10 deep. The locks, to the number of 23,
have been enlarged so as to admit forty-four gun
frigates; they are 52 <i>m.</i>, 40 in length between the
gates, 13 <i>met.</i> in breadth, and have a depth of water
of 6 <i>m.</i>, 10.</p>

<p>For cutting through the Isthmus of Panama by a
maritime canal, as projected by Mr. Garella, it was
proposed that the width of the canal, at the water
line, should be 44 <i>met.</i>, and the depth of water
7 <i>met.</i></p>

<p>Prince Louis Napoleon, who, in 1846, published
a remarkable work, inserted in the <i>Revue Britannique</i>,
under the title of <i>Canal de Nicaragua</i>,
adopted the same dimensions as Mr. Garella, in the
project which he proposed to execute for establishing
the communication between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans.</p>

<p>We have assumed on considerations hereinafter
to be explained, that paddle and screw frigates as
well as vessels of 1000 to 1500 tons, ought to be able
to traverse the Canal in order to satisfy to the fullest
extent the demands of navigation. We have therefore
fixed the width of the Canal at the water line at
100 <i>met.</i>; its <i>minimum</i> draught of water at 6 <i>m.</i>, 50,
below low water in the Mediterranean. The locks,
two in number, are to be 100 <i>met.</i> long, 21 <i>met.</i>
wide, with a <i>minimum</i> depth of water of 6 <i>m.</i>, 50.
These works will be established at the two extremities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the Canal, immediately before the dykes forming
the channel which on each side unites the Canal
with the two Seas. These two locks will form part
of a sluiced barrage, and thus convert the whole
Canal into one immense dam, receiving the waters
of the Red Sea during the highest tides, and storing
them up successively in order to raise the level and
create a rush of water in each channel when necessary.
The highest tides of the Red Sea being from
2 <i>met.</i> to 2 <i>m.</i>, 50 above low water in the Mediterranean,
a depth of 9 <i>met.</i> of water will be obtained
in the canal at certain times, but a mean super elevation
of 1 <i>m.</i> may be depended on, which will usually
give a minimum depth of 7 <i>m.</i>, 50 to 8 <i>met.</i> Under
these conditions, screw steamers will be enabled to
pass easily along the Canal without the presence of
its bed re-acting in an inconvenient manner on the
motion of their screws. We have, however, calculated
the earth-works for three different depths of
water, viz. 6 <i>met.</i>; 6 <i>m.</i>, 50; and 7 <i>met.</i> below low
water in the Mediterranean. If the Company should
require a depth of 8 <i>met.</i>, it would be easy to obtain
it by means of dredges, without stopping the navigation
on the Canal.</p>

<p>The length of each barrage, including the lock, is
100 <i>met.</i>; and in order farther to facilitate the entrance
of the rising tide into the Canal, a third barrage
has been added at Suez on the site of the existing
channel. This last work will be separated from
the first by a platform raised above the level of high
water, so that the two together will unite the road
from Cairo passing by Suez to Mecca. Its length
has also been fixed at 100 <i>met.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>For reasons of economy the width of the Canal
has been reduced to 65 <i>met.</i> wherever the height of
the ground reaches 6 <i>met.</i></p>

<p>To prevent the degradation of the banks of the
Canal, the slope has been fixed at two on the base to
one in height, and it is proposed to have a causeway
2 <i>met.</i> broad to receive, 1st. A covering of the
broken stones found along the Canal, 2nd. Any earth
falling from the higher grounds, which would otherwise
encumber the bed of the Canal. This is only
an imitation of what has proved so successful on the
Caledonian Canal.</p>

<p>The width of the towing path has been fixed at
4 <i>met.</i>, which is quite sufficient for a maritime canal
where steam towing will be so much in use.</p>

<p>Lake Timsah, situated nearly midway between the
two Seas, at the entrance of the <i>Wady Tomilat</i>, will
form, as we have said, an inland port, to which both
the outward and inward navigation will tend. On
its shores will be established magazines, stables,
workshops for repairs, as well as 1500 <i>metres</i> of
quay walls for mooring vessels and embarking merchandize.
For, as the illustrious author of the work
on the canal of Nicaragua well expresses it, the proposed
Canal must not be a mere cutting destined
solely to form a passage from one sea to the other
for the produce of Europe, but it must make Egypt
a prosperous state by enabling her to dispose of her
interior produce, and a powerful one by the extent
of her commerce.</p>

<p>As for the two entrances, whether from the Red
Sea or the Mediterranean, all that is necessary is, that
ships shall be able to approach at all seasons, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
find certain and effectual shelter in bad weather.
Now the roadstead of Suez is sheltered from every
wind except the south-east. It will therefore be sufficient
to prolong the eastern jetty to a certain distance
beyond the western to render the shelter complete.</p>

<p>All the vessels which now take their stations in
the roadstead ride out the bad weather very well, and
the magazine corvette belonging to the English Company
which has been anchored there for the last two
years and a half has suffered no damage.</p>

<p>Thus, at the Suez extremity, it will be sufficient
to establish two jetties, forming the entrance channel
from the Red Sea, and to prolong them sufficiently
far into the roadstead to reach the required depth
of water, in order that vessels entering may have a
draught of 7 <i>m.</i>, 50 to 8 <i>met.</i> at low water. The
eastern jetty must be 150 <i>met.</i> longer than the western
for the reasons we have just given.</p>

<p>At Pelusium, the two jetties, in order to reach the
depth of 7 <i>m.</i>, 50 to 8 <i>met.</i> must be at least 6000 <i>met.</i>
in length; but if it should be feared that the channel
thus formed would not be sufficiently safe for the
approach of vessels, and in order to meet objections,
the real value of which have yet to be tested, we have
projected a sheltered roadstead in front of these jetties
by means of a grand mole from 450 to 500 <i>met.</i>
in length, placed in such a manner as to afford
shelter to vessels in bad weather, and to enable them
to enter the channel at their convenience.</p>

<p>At all events no one can doubt that the Canal
would be really and practically navigable for all
vessels willing to avail themselves of the passage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
But it will be asked whether jetties extending 6000
<i>met.</i> into the sea do not present great difficulties;
whether a trench of 65 <i>met.</i> in width, dug 16 <i>m.</i>, 50
deep, a part of which is under water, is not an impossibility;
and whether, supposing the engineering
difficulties to be surmounted, the results obtained
would be in proportion to the expenses incurred.
Doubts have also been started on the navigation of
the Red Sea; finally, several authors have put the
question, without however solving it, whether, even if
the Canal were once established, commerce would
not prefer the old way by the Cape as the safest and
most advantageous.</p>

<p>These questions we are about to examine: these
doubts we shall endeavour to clear up.</p>

<p>The Gulf of Pelusium is said to be constantly
filled with sand or mud brought down by the Damietta
branch of the Nile, and it is objected that the
advanced works to be established on that part of the
shore would only have the effect of increasing the
accumulations. We admit that this portion of the
Egyptian shore has been formed by maritime alluvium
brought by the ground swell, as we have already
proved at the commencement of our memorial. We
also admit, that the object of the dykes forming the
entrance channel to the Canal, would be to stop the
sand thus brought by the waves, and to accumulate
it against the dyke opposed to the prevailing wind,
namely, against the western dyke.</p>

<p>But most of the ports already in existence are open
to the same objections; and if they were sufficient to
prevent the construction of a port, we may safely say
that very few of those we are at present acquainted
with would ever have been formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>According to our idea the essential question is, to
know whether, when once the port is established, it
can be maintained without too great an expense.</p>

<p>Now it appears, that for many ages the sands have
ceased to extend the Pelusiac shore, as is manifest
from the well ascertained position of Pelusium, the
ruins of which still remain. Strabo, in his Itinerary,
says that Pelusium is situated at the distance of
twenty stadia from the sea. The French engineers
of the expedition have verified this distance, by measuring
1600 toises, or 3000 <i>met.</i> from its remains to
the shore.</p>

<p>In 1847, the distance between these two points
had not varied, as it is marked on the plan with the
figure 3000 <i>met.</i>, and at the present day it is still
the same.</p>

<p>In fact, by reading all the accounts of ancient
authors, and comparing them with what actually
exists, we arrive at the conclusion that the shores of
the Delta have varied very little in historic times.</p>

<p>The sea sands then have long ceased to accumulate,
and the fact may be explained by assuming that
the destruction of the coasts of Morocco, Algeria,
Candia, and other parts,—which destruction, we repeat,
alone furnishes the materials of maritime alluvium,
—has abated from some cause or other. It may
also be assumed, that the sands which were formerly
driven by winds and currents into the Gulf of Pelusium,
are now cast on the African coast between
Tripoli and Alexandria, and driven inland in the
shape of downs. The fact is, that no new downs are
now seen forming in the Isthmus; those on the seashore
being of ancient formation, and nearly all
naturally fixed by vegetation. In conclusion, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
extension of the Pelusiac shore, if such extension
there be, is too insignificant to be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Now, the direction of the jetties being nearly perpendicular
to the shore, in order to be at right angles
with the prevailing wind from W. N. W., the sand,
when the wind is perpendicular to the shore, will be
driven on to the coast and increase its height, as
hitherto, no change being occasioned by the jetties.
During the parallel winds, which mostly prevail, the
littoral current, finding an obstacle in the jetties, will
form an eddy to windward, which will increase the
force of the current between the points of the jetties
and the mole, so that the sand will be carried far
away; and the probability is, that the bottom will
become deeper.</p>

<p>It is only the oblique winds then, that will carry the
sand into the angles formed by the shore and the
windward jetty.</p>

<p>In calm weather, the sea-current which flows along
the coast from west to east has not sufficient force to
affect the equilibrium of the beach. Thus, to sum
the matter up, the most that can be feared is the accumulation
of a small quantity of the loose sand in the
Gulf at the angle of the windward jetty. Supposing
that even 10,000 <i>cubic metres per ann.</i> should be
so deposited, which, according to what we have said,
is an exaggeration, it would take 100 years to advance
the beach 400 <i>metres</i>, and such an advance would
produce no perceptible effect at the extremities of the
jetties.</p>

<p>It may be objected, that by all these movements
of the sands, some portion will necessarily find its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
way into the channel, and thus, by degrees, end in
obstructing it. To obviate this inconvenience we
have at our disposal dredging machines, and the
most powerful means of clearance derived from a
mass of 700,000,000 <i>cubic metres</i> of water, which
can be stored up, above the level of low water in the
two Seas, throughout the whole extent of the Canal,
and in the immense reservoir of the Bitter Lakes.</p>

<p>But are jetties extending 6000 <i>metres</i> into the
sea possible? and if possible, would they not require
so much time and such an expenditure of money as,
practically, to cause the undertaking to be given up?</p>

<p>With regard to the possibility, there can be no
doubt, for more than a century ago the Dutch
Government constructed a jetty 8000 <i>met.</i> in length
in the Bay of the Lion, near the Cape, in water
more than sixteen <i>met.</i> deep, in spite of the continued
tempestuous weather which succeeds the settled
calms in those latitudes. Such a work, considering
the depth of water, must have required a
quantity of materials at least four times as great as
that required for the two jetties and the mole at
Pelusium. It was undertaken by a nation not over
rich, at a time when steam was unknown, and before
the invention of machinery, which saves so much
time, expense and labour. There can be no doubt
then, that if the cutting of the Isthmus is admitted
to be advantageous, it will be easy to overcome all
difficulties.</p>

<p>With regard to the method of constructing these
works, opinions are no less divided. Some engineers,
grounding their opinions on ancient constructions,
recommend that the moles should be formed of immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
blocks of stone of thirty to forty <i>cubic metres</i>.
Others are of opinion that the only means of preserving
the roads from the accumulation of sand, is
to construct the moles and dykes of open masonry.
There are also some in favour of walls in hydraulic
masonry with vertical facings. But, our own opinion
is, that in so important an enterprise, every theoretical
hypothesis should be discarded, and that we ought to
be guided solely by the experience we have acquired
in works of an analogous character already executed.
And this is what we have done in adopting the system
of loose stones, as it has been carried out with success:
1. For the dyke at Cherbourg which is 3768 <i>met.</i>
long in a depth of water of 14 <i>m.</i>, 80; 2. For the jetty
at Plymouth which is 1364 <i>met.</i> long in a depth of
11 <i>met.</i> and more; 3. For the dyke in the Bay of
Delaware 1200 <i>met.</i> long, with a depth of 14 <i>met.</i>;
4. For that of the Bay of the Lion 8000 <i>met.</i> long,
in depths of more than 16 <i>met.</i></p>

<p>Objections to this system may, indeed, be raised
on account of the damage sustained at Cherbourg
and Plymouth as well as at Algiers, before the introduction
of factitious blocks, but it is necessary to
observe, that both at Cherbourg and Plymouth, the
tidal current is exceedingly strong, its velocity being
as much as 4 <i>met.</i> per second; that the sea at these
points is very rough, and that there is reason to
suppose that the damage would not have occurred had
the blocks been rather larger, and the interstices well
filled up. With regard to the roadstead at Algiers,
it is, as is well known, constantly beaten over by
heavy seas, no other point in the Mediterranean
presenting such difficult conditions. We have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
favour of our system most of the moles erected in the
various ports of the Mediterranean, Genoa, Cannes,
Barcelona, Valencia, Cadiz, &amp;c. &amp;c., all of which
are constructed of natural blocks, the largest not
exceeding 2 <i>m.</i>, 50 cube, and which are nevertheless
established at considerable depths of water. Finally,
we have on our side the opinions of the most distinguished
English engineers; opinions which have
prevailed in Parliament, and in accordance with
which, all the moles in the harbours of refuge in
course of construction are being made, according to
the system of natural blocks sunk into the sea, at
certain slopes.</p>

<p>The bottom of the beach, descending by a very
gentle inclination, will, moreover, have the effect of
abating the waves, and diminishing their action
against the jetties. This is a well ascertained fact,
and one which may, indeed, be easily conceived; for,
supposing that the bottom of the sea, from a depth
below the limit of the motion of the waves, rises
by an extremely gentle slope, until it meets that
limit; this meeting taking place at a very small
angle, the bottom will be almost insensibly substituted
for the limit of motion.</p>

<p>At the point of this meeting the undulating motion
is <i>nil</i>, it is very feeble at the adjacent points,
and easily abated by the resistance and friction
which the molecules experience against the bottom.
The abatement will thus extend vertically up to the
surface, and the waves will then gradually diminish
in volume as they approach the shore.</p>

<p>We have, therefore, adopted the system of loose
stones for the jetties and for the mole, with but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
slight modifications suggested by our own experience,
modifications which consist in making the
jetty-heads in hydraulic masonry to a certain height,
as well as the interior surface of the windward jetty,
which is to serve for the towing of vessels.</p>

<p>What we have said of the gulf of Pelusium we
may repeat, still more forcibly, with regard to the
roadstead of Suez. The sands have long ceased to
accumulate in any perceptible manner. And if
maritime alluvium is still brought up by the ground
swell and the current, it is driven by the west and
south-west winds on to the eastern shore, without
reaching the extremity of the gulf. In fact, the plan
of the roadstead was taken in 1799, and the soundings
of the channel are marked, as well as the shape of
the sandbank, which forms a kind of bar at its extremity
towards the roadstead. In 1847, the plan
was taken again with the same soundings, and it is
impossible to find the least difference between the
two results, which also agree with those given by
Commander Moresby, in his excellent chart of the
Red Sea.</p>

<p>There is, then, nothing to fear on that side, either
from the sand or the violence of the sea. The jetties
will be of the simplest construction, and as the
materials are, as it were, at hand, their erection will
present no difficulty.</p>

<p>With regard to the excavation of the Canal to a
depth of 6 <i>m.</i>, 50 below low water in the Mediterranean,
in a very porous soil, the task, at first sight,
presents what appear to be considerable difficulties.
We cannot, indeed, hope to accomplish the whole
of the excavation in the dry, or by pumping, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of the nature of the ground. It will be necessary,
then, for all that portion below water, to
have recourse to dredging; and, as the quantity of
earth to be removed by this means is 57,205,342
<i>cubic metres</i>, at first sight it is difficult to conceive
how the work is to be accomplished. But,
upon examining the matter more closely, nothing is
found to frighten the most timorous. In fact, a
single steam dredging machine, of twenty horse
power, such as those which have been employed on
the Nile, working night and day, can, in twenty-four
hours, raise 1000 <i>cubic metres</i> of sand, from a
depth of seven <i>metres</i>. According to this calculation,
and supposing the year to consist of only
270 working days, it would take forty dredging
machines five years to complete the labour; but if,
instead of such small machines, dredges of thirty to
thirty-five horse power were adopted, it would be
easy to raise 1500 <i>cubic metres per diem</i>, and the
dredging would be more economical.</p>

<p>The quantity of earth to be raised by manual
labour amounts to 17,473,790 <i>cubic metres</i>, and the
deepest cutting does not exceed 10 <i>metres</i> above the
water. This is a small matter when compared with
the earth-works performed in many canal and railway
undertakings, and even with those accomplished
before the present century; such, for example, as
the one mentioned by Michel Chevalier, in his
investigations concerning the maritime canal of the
Isthmus of Panama (<i>Recherches sur la Canalisation
maritime de l’Isthme de Panama</i>).</p>

<p>“It required,” says he, “the treasure which the
Viceroys of Mexico had at their disposal to undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the cutting at Huehuetoca, the total length
of which is 29,585 <i>met.</i>, with a depth of from
45 to 60 <i>met.</i>, for a length of 800 <i>met.</i>, and from
30 to 50 <i>met.</i> for 3500 <i>met.</i> The expense was
31,000,000.”</p>

<p>Farther on, he adds:—</p>

<p>“Nowadays, however, in a case of necessity, by
displaying the improved appliances at the command
of engineering art, it would be possible to
effect cuttings of great depth, and to remove large
quantities of earth at no extraordinary expense.
On the Arles canal, at Bouc, for instance, the
plateau of the Lecque was cut through by a trench
2100 <i>met.</i> in length, by 40 to 50 <i>met.</i> in depth,
at the culminating point. The expense was under
4,000,000, and yet the cutting was performed by
the old method. In cuttings of magnitude, the
soil is now broken by instruments of enormous
power, and the earth is removed by means of railways
and locomotives. All that has to be done
by manual labour is to collect the loose earth and
load the waggons. For so important an object as
the uniting of two seas, even the impossible might
be attempted.”</p>

<p>Supposing each labourer to do 1 <i>m.</i>, 50, on an
average, <i>per diem</i>, it would only require 8000
labourers for five years to complete the earth-works;
and not a year passes without a levy of between
30 and 40,000 men being commanded by the Viceroy,
in several provinces at once, for the service of
the canals alone.</p>

<p>As soon as the project of a ship canal across the
Isthmus of Suez is ascertained to be useful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
advantageous, no difficulties of execution, however great
they may be (and we have proved them trifling),
will be considered obstacles to its being carried out.</p>

<p>It would appear at first sight superfluous to demonstrate
the utility of such an undertaking, for
what especially strikes the imagination, is the magnitude
of the results promised by the Canal, and the
reiterated efforts made at several epochs, even in
times of ignorance, to open this communication between
the two Seas.</p>

<p>But since the publication of M. Lepère’s memorial,
so many objections have been brought forward and
so many doubts raised, that public opinion is undecided,
and it becomes necessary to re-establish the
question in all its integrity. We will therefore
examine the principal objections raised against the
direct communication between the two Seas.</p>

<p>It has been said that the navigation of the Red Sea
is so dangerous, and that the monsoons cause such
delays, that even if the Canal were established and
freely traversed by ships, commerce would not follow
that route, which would in fact, from these peculiar
circumstances, be the longest and most perilous.</p>

<p>In the first place, there can be no question here
about steam navigation, the circle of which extends
daily more and more, for the projected Canal will be
the triumph of steam; it will greatly increase the use
of the screw, and give a new stimulus to British navigation,
which will be charged with the delivery of
English coal throughout the whole line from London
to Australia. We will therefore only examine the
case of navigation by sailing vessels. Now, we learn
from history, that from the most distant ages, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
navigation has flourished in the Red Sea, and that
after the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope (in
1497), the Portuguese considered it necessary to
have a fleet, which, in 1538, destroyed all the merchant
vessels of the Turks and Venetians. If in
later times commerce took the way of the Cape, we
have only to thank the Turkish sovereignty of the
period, which allowed the arts, sciences, and industry
to perish, at the same time that it forbade the navigation
of the Red Sea to the European nations.
How can this navigation be considered full of danger
at the present day, when nautical science and
the art of ship-building have made such great progress,
and when everything relating to the winds, the
currents, and the coasts of the Red Sea, is perfectly
well known?</p>

<p>To leave no doubt on the subject, we will repeat
the most important observations which have been
made on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>This is what the English traveller, Bruce, says in
1769:—</p>

<p>“Those who are at all acquainted with the history
of Egypt, are aware that the north wind, there
called the Etesian wind, prevails during the six
hottest months of the year. The two chains of
mountains, which confine Egypt to the east and
west, compel this wind to follow precisely this northerly
direction. It is reasonable to suppose that it
would be the same for the Arabian Gulf, if the course
of that narrow sea were parallel to the land of Egypt.
But the Red Sea extends nearly from north-west to
south-east, from Suez to Mocha; there it alters its
course, and proceeds nearly from east to west, as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
as its junction with the Indian Ocean at the straits
of Bab-el-Mandeb.</p>

<p>“Thus the Etesian wind, which is due north in
Egypt, follows the course of the gulf, and blows with
force in that direction all the summer; that is to
say, that from the month of April till the month
of October, the north-east wind prevails over the
whole extent of the Red Sea, descending as far as
the straits; and that from November to March,
the wind has quite a contrary direction, and ascends
the gulf from the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb,
up to the Isthmus of Suez.</p>

<p>“It is observed, then, that a vessel starting from
Suez, in any of the summer months encounters a
very violent north-west wind, which will carry it
direct from the gulf to Mocha. At Mocha the coast
goes from east to west, as far as the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.
Thus a vessel sailing from Mocha will,
in a short space of time, experience variable winds
but mostly blowing from the west, and these winds
will soon carry it to the straits. It therefore no
longer wants the monsoon of the gulf, which blew
from the north; and when it has passed into the
Indian Ocean, it meets with another monsoon blowing
in an opposite direction, during the six summer
months, to the one which had favoured its
progress in the Red Sea. This monsoon is no less
favourable; it blows from the south-west, and carries
the ship full sail, without delay or obstacle, into
any required port of India.</p>

<p>“Returning, the same advantages may be secured
by setting sail during the winter months with the
monsoon peculiar to that sea, which then blows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
from the north-east, and will carry the ship to the
straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. When the straits are
passed it will meet with a south-east wind in the
gulf, exactly contrary to the one in the ocean,
but the course of the ship is also contrary, and
this south-east wind, following the direction of the
gulf, will bring it to Suez. All this is clear, simple,
and easily understood, and thus it is, that in the
earliest ages the commerce of India was carried
on without any difficulty.</p>

<p>“Thus the philosophy, the observation and the
indefatigable perseverance of man, who endeavours
to carry out every project which his interest suggests,
triumphing over difficulties, have taught the
navigators of the Arabian Gulf, that those periodical
winds which they had, at first, regarded as
insuperable obstacles to the trade of the Indian
Ocean, are, when understood, the safest and the
quickest means of performing the voyage.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rooke, an English officer, speaks in these
terms, of the navigation of the Red Sea in a letter
dated April 25, 1782.</p>

<p>“The construction and management of the vessels
are equally singular, and I fear any description
will fall infinitely short of the original; they were,
I believe, designed by those who built them, to
bear some resemblance to ships, but, having few
of the properties of those machines, proceed on a
principle totally different from any I before beheld;
that <i>primum mobile</i> to which ships of other countries
are indebted for their voyages is here of little
use, and calms are more favourable than wind to
forward their progress; ... they ... seem equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
averse to a fair as to a contrary wind, remaining
at anchor until it subsides into a calm, their busy
scene then commences, the anchor is weighed and
the vessel put in motion by means of the boat with
about twenty oars in it, towing till a breeze springs
up; when this begins to be more than what our
seamen call a light air, they hurry to the shore
and let go their anchor, and for this purpose always
choose a berth the most environed by rocks and
shoals, never thinking themselves secure but when
in the midst of danger; their common time of
anchoring was about two o’clock in the afternoon,
for about that time the breeze generally freshened,
and in proportion as that increases they put out
anchors, till they have six in the water, and two
or three hawsers besides, to tie them to the surrounding
rocks: ... in what they called good
weather, we had not above two anchors out, and
if it fell calm after sunset they ventured to get one
of them up, that they might be ready for the land
breeze in the morning, which generally sprung up
at two o’clock and blew till nine or ten.... I believe,
without these land breezes we should never
have arrived at Suez; a circumstance that very
frequently happens to many vessels of this annual
fleet, for if they do not make good their passage
before the latter end of May, the northerly winds
blow so constantly as to render it impossible, for
vessels that cannot work to windward, to get up
the narrow channel from Tor to Suez.</p>

<p>“When it is remembered that the journey from
London to Madras has been performed in sixty-three
days, it is surprising to see the English neglect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
so great an advantage when they have the
power of securing it.”</p>

<p>Vice Admiral Rosily, who navigated the Red Sea
in 1789, on board the frigate Venus, and who was
consulted by M. Lepère, was far from admitting the
dangers and difficulties of the Red Sea to be as great
as is usually supposed. In fact, these dangers, conjured
up solely by the ignorance of ancient and
modern navigators, have been accredited by general
opinion, or rather by general mistake. The frigate
Venus traversed the Red Sea in all directions without
experiencing either damage or difficulty. We
may therefore rest assured, that no merchant vessel
will encounter any difficulties but those which are
inseparable from all narrow seas; the Adriatic, which
is still narrower than the Red Sea, has never been
considered impassable.</p>

<p>The coasts alone of the Red Sea are dangerous,
but the number of anchorages is so great that the
sailors of the country never navigate at night, but
anchor every evening. In rough weather they remain
at anchor sometimes for a week or a fortnight
at the same place, without daring to gain the open
sea or take advantage of any wind that would be
favourable to an European ship.</p>

<p>The excellent work of Commander Moresby and
Captain Rogers on the Red Sea, written by command
of the East India Company, to resolve the
question of its navigation, and in consequence of
which the steam service of the Red Sea was established;
this excellent work, we say, if it does not
represent the monsoons to be as regular as is stated
by Bruce, does not contradict the generality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
facts given by that traveller, as may be judged from
the following extracts:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Of the Winds and Currents between Suez and
Geddah, by Captain Moresby.</span></p>

<p>“From Suez to Geddah, during the whole course
of the year, the wind is generally north, and blows,
at times, with great violence; but it abates usually
at the change of the moon. During the winter
months, from December to April, the south wind
prevails, sometimes for a few days, and occasionally
blows fresh, more particularly in the Sea of Suez,
where it sometimes attains the force of a moderate
gust. At this season gusts from the west are
not uncommon in the Sea of Suez, and are much
dreaded by the inhabitants in consequence of their
violence. On the Arabian coast, near Geddah,
to the south and north of that port, the north and
north-west winds sometimes blow with great violence
during the winter months, and bring with
them clouds of dust from the land.</p>

<p>“The south wind, which blows sometimes from
October to May, generally occasions a current of
twenty or thirty miles a day. After a gust from
the north-west, when there is a light breeze, there
is generally a current towards the north. It is
then better to beat along the Arabian side than the
Egyptian, as was the practice of ancient navigators,
who considered the latter coast more healthy.</p>

<p>“The average length of the passage from Geddah
to Cosseir depends so much on circumstances, that
it is impossible to assign any fixed term for it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
is, however, rarely more than twenty or less than
ten days. With the boats of the country it takes
from twenty-five to thirty days, and sometimes
more.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On the Winds and Currents of the Red Sea
throughout the Year, by Capt. Rogers.</span></p>

<p>“From the beginning of October to the end of
April, during what we may call the winter months,
between the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb and Gebel
Tor, in about latitude 15° 30´ north, the wind may
be said to blow continually from the south, with
the exception of a day or two at the time of the
new or full moon, when it sometimes blows from
the north. But frequently, for two months at a
time, there is no change.</p>

<p>“From Gebel Tor to latitude 19° or 20° the
winds are variable at the same period, and blow
as much from the north as from the south. One
or other of these winds respectively prevails as
you approach one or the other of these limits.</p>

<p>“From 21° to 27° the north wind prevails during
the same season, but half a lunation seldom passes
without there being one or two days of south wind,
especially from the end of November to the beginning
of March.</p>

<p>“From 27° to Suez, the wind is, almost constantly,
north, and seldom interrupted by any wind from
the south, unless it be in the months of December,
January, and February.</p>

<p>“In June, July, August, and September the
north wind prevails without interruption, throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the whole extent of the Red Sea, from Suez to
Bab-el-Mandeb. Occasionally a change takes
place, from the land side, principally in August
and September, and during these months a fast
sailer can make thirty-five miles a-day, beating
from Mocha to Suez. In December, January,
and February, a vessel will sometimes meet with
a good wind from Mocha to Cosseir, and accomplish
the run in six or seven days, whereas it is
impossible to do the same from Cosseir to Mocha
except in summer.”</p>

</div>

<p>It appears from these extracts that the Red Sea
is easily navigable, at all seasons, by sailing vessels,
and that it is always possible so to arrange the periods
of departure as to traverse it in both directions.</p>

<p>We ought also to take into account the inconveniences
experienced in the voyage round the Cape,
resulting from the settled calms succeeding the continued
tempests, the diseases which decimate the
crews, and the disasters which are so frequent on
passing the equator. We should also take into consideration
that, if the difficulties are greater during
a good part of the year for vessels going up the Red
Sea, vessels coming down are, for that very reason,
sure to meet with favourable winds.</p>

<p>To leave no doubt on so important a question,
and on which depends, in part, the success of the
enterprise in contemplation, we will give a passage
from a paper communicated to the <i>Société de Géographie</i>,
by Count d’Escayrac de Lauture, the motto
of which is,</p>

<p class="center">“Aperire terram gentibus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the <i>minimum</i> distances which separate the
ports of Europe from those of India, on the one
part by the Cape of Good Hope, and on the other
by the Canal of the two Seas, be compared with
each other, enormous differences in favour of the
latter route will be made manifest. These differences
become still greater, when it is recollected
that, in navigation, a straight line is far from being
the shortest way from one point to another, and
that navigators only reach their destination by
successively following a certain number of courses,
which form greater or lesser angles with each
other.</p>

<p>“So that instead of steering directly for the Cape
of Good Hope, mariners starting from Europe or
the Atlantic ports of North America to go to
India, must make the Canaries or the Azores;
get into the track of the trade winds of the northern
hemisphere, reach the coast of Brazil, and
make Cape Frio, or put in at Rio Janeiro. It is
only then that they can make for the Cape of Good
Hope, better named, perhaps, Cape Tempestuous.
They clear at length the Agulhas Bank, reach
Bourbon or the Mauritius, and thence proceed to
India in the track of the monsoon.</p>

<p>“Vessels from the Mediterranean have still greater
disadvantages to contend against. It frequently
takes them a fortnight to pass the straits of Gibraltar,
in consequence of the west wind which prevails
in those straits, and the rapid current which
pours the waters of the ocean into the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>“The consequence is, that the passage to India
takes at least from five months to five months and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
half. The passage back is rather more direct, without
being to any perceptible degree shorter. The
coast of Africa may then be followed more closely,
thanks to the trade winds of the southern hemisphere.
The place to put in at, in this case, is
St. Helena.</p>

<p>“If we now examine the conditions to which navigation
is subjected in the three seas nearest to
Suez, that is to say, the Mediterranean, the Red
Sea, and the Gulf of Oman, we shall find that in
the Mediterranean the winds blow from the north
during the greater part of the year, change to the
south by east towards the spring, and return to
the north, passing by the west and north-west.
The case is nearly the same with regard to the
Red Sea, where the north wind, which is the most
frequent, drives the waters in the direction of Bab-el-Mandeb,
so that when the calm succeeds, a current
is observed running north. This is evidently
produced by the waters which had been raised in
the south endeavouring to regain their level. The
south wind usually succeeds the calm.</p>

<p>“The Gulf of Oman has two monsoons, that from
the north-east, which prevails with more constancy
in the winter, and that from the south-west, which
blows with force in summer. The change from
one monsoon to the other is effected, there as elsewhere,
by a series of calms and gusts of wind.</p>

<p>“From these circumstances it would appear most
advantageous to sail to India by the canal in summer
and autumn, and to return towards the spring.</p>

<p>“The great shortening of the distance between
the ports of Europe, and those of India, is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
only advantage which commerce will derive by
frequenting the canal of the two Seas. In fact,
vessels will not only reach their destination in a
shorter time, but will meet on their route with
numerous ports to put in at, and, what is more
important still, considerable markets. The voyager,
after having followed the easy track of the
Mediterranean, will sell a part of his cargo in the
Canal of Suez, or at Geddah; will buy ivory at
Massaoux, Souken and Berbera, which he will
either exchange in India, for opium, or carry on
to China to obtain silk or tea.</p>

<p>“He will complete his homeward cargo with the
colonial produce of Manilla, the Sunda Islands,
and Ceylon, with cotton from India, or Egypt,
with coffee from Abyssinia, or Yemen, with gum
from Soudan or Hedjaz, with corn from Lower
Egypt, or with rice from Damietta. And these
multifarious operations, which now require years,
will be safely and rapidly accomplished with little
capital and small ships.</p>

<p>“In fact, by reducing the time required for commercial
operations we also reduce the general costs,
make a much greater number of these operations
possible in a given time, and, by that means, give
facilities to small traders, by far the most numerous
class.</p>

<p>“By opening to navigation an easier and safer
route, we bring into use ships of less tonnage, and
more economically equipped; in one word, we throw
open the road to India to the coasting trade—<span class="smcapuc">WE
DEMOCRATISE COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>To these details, we will add our own personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
observations. We may say that the navigation of
the Red Sea is always easy, from the straits to Raz
Mohammed, because there are no rocks in the middle
of the gulf, and it being always possible to beat when
the monsoon is not favourable, and if some danger is
to be feared at Raz Mohammed, from whirlwinds,
currents and rocks, they will disappear as soon as a
good lighthouse is erected, and a station of steam
tugs established to assist vessels against the contrary
winds.</p>

<p>Sailing may then be said to have attained the
limit of its advantages, for it will profit by favourable
winds to perform the transport service with
economy; and in those parts of the passage where
difficulties are to be encountered, steam will come
in aid, by which danger and loss of time will be
avoided.</p>

<p>Another objection which has been raised against
the direct canal is, that being cut through moving
downs, it will soon be encumbered by them, and that
the expense of keeping it in order, will consequently
be so great, that it will be necessary to abandon it,
if it ever be undertaken.</p>

<p>To refute this objection we will recapitulate the
facts in their actual integrity.</p>

<p>From Suez to the extremity of the Bitter Lakes,
the soil is, it is true, sandy at the surface, but however
sandy it may be, the winds do not produce any
modification in the superficial state of this part of
the Isthmus.</p>

<p>This is to be accounted for by the fine sand being
kept moist by the sea water, which reaches the surface
by percolation and capillary attraction; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
sand, which is out of reach of the moisture, is coarse
sand, or rather small gravel, bound together by
magnesian earth, in such a manner that the wind
has no effect upon it. So true is this, that at several
places in this desert we found, in December,
1854, the traces left by the tents of the engineers
who were employed there in 1847.</p>

<p>The best proof that can be given of the stability
of the soil in this part of the desert is the situation
of the banks of the ancient canal, which still remain
all along, as far as the Bitter Lakes. The torrents
of rain which sometimes fall in this locality, may
well, in 1200 years, have worn ravines in these
banks, and partly filled the canal. In some parts
even, the banks have been carried away by sudden
torrents, but nowhere are they buried by the sand.
Vestiges of antiquity, two or three thousand years
old, may still be seen at the surface of the soil on
the very line through which the canal is to pass.
It is only on approaching Lake Timsah that moveable
downs are met with, which surround and cut it in
several places, changing their shape rather than their
position; all the other downs which are met with in
the form of chains of hillocks, and which occupy
the space comprised between the bar of El Guisr and
Pelusium, have long been naturally fixed by various
plants, which have sprung up there under the influence
of heat and moisture. It is, then, only the
downs in the vicinity of Lake Timsah which require
to be fixed artificially. Now, the fixing of downs
has already become a special branch of industry
presenting great advantages. The hills of sand
which devastated the <i>Landes</i> of Bordeaux, and advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
every year into the interior of the country,
rendering it barren, are now transformed into magnificent
pine forests, which yield turpentine, pitch,
various kinds of resin and timber.</p>

<p>This change, or rather this miracle, was effected
by the simplest means. After an attentive examination
of the facts, M. Bremontier, engineer-general,
to whom we are indebted for the fixing of the
downs, had observed that, in digging at the summit
of the most elevated downs, the sand was moist at a
few <i>centimetres</i> from the surface.</p>

<p>Struck by this circumstance, he saw at once that
vegetation would be possible, if the sand could be
prevented from being displaced by the wind. He
consequently imagined various means of obtaining
this result, and his efforts were crowned with complete
success. He sowed on several downs the seeds
of the maritime pine, which have now become magnificent
forests.</p>

<p>After being assured, by long experience, of the
advantages which might be derived from the fixing
of the downs, M. Bremontier addressed a report to
the Government of the Republic, in which are found
the following valuations:—</p>

<p>“The surface of the downs, which form the
<i>Landes</i> of Bordeaux,” says he, “being equal to
337,000 <i>Bordeaux journaux</i>, of 840 <i>square toises</i>,
the amount required to fix the whole of these
downs would be 8,000,000 <i>livres</i>. Now, a <i>journal</i>
(0 <i>hect.</i>, 33) of sand planted with pines, gives an
annual return of fifteen <i>livres</i>, that of 337,000
<i>journaux</i> would therefore be of 5,055,000 <i>livres</i>.
It is supposed here that the <i>Journal</i> planted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
pines only yields three quintals of resin, and the
price may be taken at five francs the quintal; but
the plantations, at the end of seven or eight years,
will produce an immense quantity of combustibles,
and afterwards charcoal, boards, timber for
building, and finally tar. It is true that the pines
are not of full value until twenty or twenty-five
years after planting; there will be, however, an
interest of twelve and a half per cent. as a deduction
from all expenses.”</p>

<p>Much more simple means are employed at present,
to fix the downs by sowing, for it is mostly
considered sufficient to plant branches of broom,
furze, or pine in quincunx upon the down to be sown
and to scatter various seeds broadcast, and cover
them lightly with a rake. These are called <i>tufted
seed plots</i>. The expense of a <i>hectare</i> is 66 <i>fr.</i>, 80,
which is made up as follows, as appears from the
accounts kept by the engineers entrusted with these
works:—</p>

<p>At the eighth year they begin to yield interest on
the capital and cost of keeping up (which is almost
nothing), from the combustible that is obtained by
removing the surplus, from making charcoal, &amp;c. &amp;c.
At twenty years they begin to extract resin from the
trees, at thirty years the produce is most abundant,
and continues up to eighty years, when the wood is
fit for building purposes. Then new seed plots are
formed in proportion as the old trees are removed.</p>

<p>The annual produce of resin gathered from a <i>hectare</i>
of pines is an average of five <i>metric quintals</i>,
which, at the rate of twenty-two <i>francs</i> per quintal,
gives a revenue of 110 <i>francs</i>, and represents at least
seventy per cent. of the capital employed.</p>

<p>It will be seen by this statement, that the fixing
of the downs has become one of the most productive
operations of Silviculture, and that it offers one of
the most advantageous investments for capital.</p>

<p>It was therefore necessary for us to know, whether
the downs which cover the northern part of the
Isthmus could be fixed by the same process. Now,
we have ascertained, 1st. That the greater part of
these downs are naturally fixed by a multitude of
different plants, which have found sufficient moisture
for their support; 2nd. That the moveable downs of
the basin of Lake Timsah conceal moisture at a very
little depth below their surface; they may, therefore,
be fixed by seed plots, and to do it there is the
immense quantity of bushes and shrubs which grow
in the low parts surrounding the lake, and which
give to that region the appearance of a copse.</p>

<p>Not only will sufficient branches be found on the
spot for the tufted seed plots, but moreover, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
combustibles for the lime, and for the wants of the
workmen, will be furnished abundantly.</p>

<p>It is true, that at the time we made our observations
(January, 1855), tolerably abundant rains had
recently moistened the soil; the success of the seed-plots,
which would be destitute of moisture for the
rest of the year, might therefore be doubted; but
what is there to prevent the moist season being
chosen for making these plots? and the seed once
risen, the abundant moisture which is felt in this region,
especially during the summer nights, will suffice
to support vegetation, as is seen by the downs
fixed naturally. Finally, to remove all objections,
the fresh water canal which will end at Lake Timsah,
will supply, if required, the means of affording,
during the early days of the seed-plots, sufficient
moisture for the success of the undertaking.</p>

<p>There is no possible doubt then as to the success
which will be obtained in the fixing of the moveable
downs, nor as to the pecuniary advantages which
result from it, for the maritime pine answers well in
Egypt, and other kinds of trees may be found still
more productive. The cost of sowing will be less
than in France, on account of the low price of labour,
and the profits will be more considerable and more
quickly obtained, on account of the hotter climate,
and the consumption on the spot of all produce now
wanting, and which is obliged to be procured from
a distance.</p>

<p>We estimate the superfice of the downs to be fixed
in this part of the Isthmus at about 2000 <i>hectares</i>,
but if seed-plots and replantations were made upon
all the downs naturally fixed, 100,000 <i>hectares</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
forest might thus be formed. It is for the Company
to decide what extent of country it will be suitable
to cultivate in this way. A final objection has been
made to the Canal by assuming that steam navigation,
by the agitation of the water which it produces,
would quickly destroy the banks of the Canal,—banks
formed in a moveable soil which would fill up
the trough.</p>

<p>To guard against this inconvenience, which might,
in fact, be apprehended, we have adopted very gentle
slopes (two on the base line to one in height);
then we have covered these slopes with stones for the
whole height on which the agitation caused by the
passage of steam-vessels could be felt. We have in
our favour the example of the Caledonian Canal,
thus furnished with a covering of stones formed of
simple materials. This is what M. Flachat says, in
the description that he gives of this Canal, according
to the reports of the Commissioners of the House
of Commons: “Steam navigation especially demands
attention. Difficult, perhaps even impossible,
upon ordinary canals, where it causes an agitation
which rapidly destroys the banks, it is
organized on the Caledonian Canal, and presents
nothing but advantages. With a speed of 11,000 to
12,000 <i>met.</i> per hour, all that has been observed is
<i>a general plashing, which is not more than that
produced by a moderately gentle wind</i>. The only
precaution taken was, to collect on the banks
and made ground all the large pebbles with which
the land is filled, and to cover with them for a
foot in height below the line of the water, the
banks which, from the coarse composition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
soil, were too easily disturbed by the agitation
of the waves. But wherever the ground had a
good proportion of sand, there was nothing to
be done.” Finally, it has been assumed, that
the Government of Great Britain, yielding to a
national prejudice, would put obstacles in the way
of the project of cutting through the Isthmus, if it
should be ascertained to be feasible, and that the
English capitalists would not be disposed to concur
in the undertaking. The future alone can show
what truth there is in this assumption; we cannot
at all conceive the opposition of the Government of
a great nation to a project to which the English have
especially, in these latter times, drawn the attention
of the commercial world and their own Government
on account of the special advantages which it offers
to England. We have already referred to the writings
of the traveller Bruce and those of Captain
Rooke. We will now cite other names.</p>

<p>Captain James Vetch, of the corps of Royal Engineers,
author of a very remarkable pamphlet published
in London in 1843, and Mr. Clarkson, Civil
Engineer, propose to trace the Canal in a single
straight line from Suez to Tineh.</p>

<p>The editor of the Engineers’ and Architects’ journal
(1844) in giving an account of the labours of
these engineers, adopts in starting from Suez, the
line of the ancient canal as far as the Bitter Lakes,
and from the head of these lakes at Katieh he takes
the direction of the Mediterranean in passing by
the great lake Sulak el Bardoil.</p>

<p>The author adds, “It is hardly reasonable to
reckon upon a union of the European powers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
effect an undertaking in which England has such
a preponderating interest, in the point of view of
our domination in India. It is true that all the
Nations bordering on the Mediterranean would
find large profit therein, but much inferior however
to ours.”</p>

<p>The Foreign Quarterly Review, one of the most
esteemed periodicals of England, in an article where
it treats of the cutting of the Isthmus, says that—“the
expense compared with the grandeur of the
result is so trivial, that it is astonishing that the
thing has not yet been done, either by a company or
by the Viceroy. The advantages of this undertaking
would be immense; for, independently of
the great commerce which would be done there,
independently of the opening of Abyssinia and of
the interior of Africa to the arts and civilization,
the Red Sea abounds in natural riches, and the
fishermen of the Mediterranean would transport
themselves thither in crowds in pursuit of pearls,
mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell, sponges (the finest
in the world), coral, fish oils, &amp;c. &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson in his pamphlet already quoted,
says: “In a political point of view, the advantages
which the English Government will derive from
the Canal are almost incalculable. From Malta
troops could be transported to Bombay in three
weeks, to Ceylon and Madras in four weeks, and
to Calcutta in thirty-five days at most, instead of
the four or five months now required by a sailing
vessel. Under such circumstances it would require
scarcely half the number of English troops
for the efficient government of India. The facility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for despatching ships of war with munitions and
men would thus increase the stability of the British
power, while the cost would be considerably
diminished.”</p>

<p>“In a commercial point of view, the advantages
would be still more considerable: British India
contains a population of 150,000,000, including,
with the subjects of the British Crown, its allies
and tributaries. China does not contain less than
350,000,000 of inhabitants: to say nothing of the
other rich and populous countries of the East.
Let us suppose that in consequence of the progress
and developement of commerce, each Indian and
Chinese should augment his outlay in the purchase
of English produce by one shilling; this modification
alone, insignificant as it appears, would augment
the amount of exports by 25,000,000. Now
is it not evident that the opening of the Maritime
Canal will greatly facilitate commercial relations,
and tend to lower the price of all merchandize? the
500,000,000 of human beings peopling India and
China are still sunk in ignorance and superstition.
With steam navigation, which will be developed
beyond all conception by the opening of the Canal,
these people, brought into daily communication
with European ideas, will enter by degrees into
the current of science and civilization.”</p>

<p>We will terminate these quotations by an extract
from a very remarkable work published in the “Papers
for the People,” inserted in the <i>Revue Britannique</i> (for
1852), and in which the cutting through the Isthmus
is regarded as a practical solution of the maintenance
of the British power in India. We read there:—“If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in spite of the concourse of several adverse circumstances,
we firmly believe that our country will be
able to effect the union of the two Seas, it is because
this measure will soon become imperiously necessary
for the maintenance of our empire ... all
nations would find immense advantage in the creation
of a new route opened to navigation; this evident
advantage, offered to the European states
nearer to Africa, has even been seriously adduced
as a fit argument to divert England from an enterprise,
the result of which might be problematical.
We encounter here one of the old distrusts of that
worn-out theory, that miserable tissue of mistakes
that took upon itself to teach, that a people
is only rich and flourishing in proportion as its
neighbours are indigent and unfortunate. Doubtless
the countries of Europe nearest to the East
will derive a considerable profit from the opening
of the Isthmus of Suez, but our egotism ought
to find therein a motive for satisfaction; for we
cannot be ignorant of the fact, that the developement
of commerce, whatever the means employed,
always ends by bringing the better part of the
profits to the most intelligent and most numerous
firms. For our own part, such is our belief.
England, and more than one other nation by its
example, appear to us called to great works which
will throw into shade the most striking deeds of
history. Among these works of the future, it appears
to us that the cutting through the Isthmuses
of Panama and Suez stand in the first rank, and
which multiplying and strengthening the ties by
which people of all climates, of all races, of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
beliefs are united to Great Britain, will connect
for ever the general prosperity of nations with the
happiness of our country, their security with its
power, their independence with its liberty.”</p>

<p>We believe we have abundantly proved the possibility
of constructing the Maritime Canal with its
two entrances, one from the Mediterranean, the other
from the Red Sea, and its interior harbour at Lake
Timsah. The facilities and advantages which it
offers to commerce and navigation as well as to
Egypt can no longer be a matter of doubt, and let
us say with the illustrious author of the memorial
upon the Nicaragua Canal:—“Think of the almost
miraculous effects which will be produced by the
annual passage across this fine country of 2 to
3000 vessels, which would exchange their productions
for those of the East, and cause life and
riches to circulate everywhere. We may picture
to ourselves those shores, now so solitary, peopled
with towns and villages; those lakes now gloomy
and silent, furrowed by ships; those rugged lands
fertilised, and the interior canal carrying the benefits
of civilization into the heart of the country.”</p>

<p>It only now remains to enter upon the financial
and economical considerations of the undertaking;
but before approaching this part of the question, it
is necessary to complete the exposition of the scheme
by describing the canal of communication and irrigation
which will connect the interior of Egypt with
the Maritime Canal.</p>

<p>This Canal must fulfil three conditions.</p>

<p>It should be of a section sufficiently large to admit
the craft and steam boats that navigate the Nile, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
order to allow access to the interior harbour from
all points of Egypt without the inconvenience of
trans-shipment. The volume of water to be supplied
to the Canal should be sufficient, after allowing
for all losses by evaporation, infiltration, and the
passage of the locks, for the irrigation of 100,000
<i>feddans</i> (40,000 <i>hectares</i>) during the winter, and
60,000 <i>feddans</i> (24,000 <i>hectares</i>) during the summer.
Lastly, the level of the water ought to be
maintained at the most favourable height for the
natural irrigation of the immense tracts of land in
the Isthmus which now remain barren for want of
water.</p>

<p>To fulfil these conditions, the receipt of water for
the alimentary and irrigating Canal may be established
a little above Boulak at Kusr el Nil where
the mouth of the Kalidj Zafranieh is, which loses
itself to the north of Cairo in the Kalidj Manjeh,
the ancient canal of Trajan and Amrou; this canal
was partly re-excavated by Mehemet Ali to nearly
the same dimensions as those required for the new
Canal, and as far as Tell el Zoudieh. By following
this track a great economy is already obtained. The
Canal also exists farther on as far as Belbeïs, but of
smaller dimensions; from Belbeïs, in order to maintain
the water at a suitable height, the Canal is made
to pass a little more to the East outside the cultivated
lands, which will give the Company an opportunity
of irrigating and fertilising the bordering tracts at
present uncultivated. The canal then proceeds
northward as far as <i>Ras el Wady</i> (head of the valley),
the Pitoum of the Bible. This course exists
of small dimensions, but in several parts of its route<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it may be turned to account. There will not be
great expense in completing the line as far as Lake
Timsah; life would thus be given to Cairo by traversing
it with a navigable passage, of which it is
destitute at present. It would then be necessary,
during the time of the low water, to raise the waters
of the Nile to a height of three <i>metres</i> by means of
steam pumps of 500 horse power; and when the barrage,
for which His Highness Mohammed Saïd
Pacha has a project, is completed, the reflux will
facilitate, with the assistance of steam power, the introduction
of the waters of the Nile into the Canal
during the six months of the low waters.</p>

<p>The width of the Canal has been fixed at 25 <i>met.</i>,
measured on the water line at the time of the inundation.
This width is sufficient to allow two steam
boats to pass each other without inconvenience.
Moreover, precautionary measures may be adopted
at the entrances of the locks, to prevent collisions,
if it should become necessary hereafter.</p>

<p>The depth of the bed of the Canal below the natural
surface of the ground in the first part or first
dam, as far as the north of Tell el Zondieh, is 7 <i>metres</i>,
that is to say, at the level of the low waters of the
river, and at 14 <i>metres</i> above the level of low water
in the Mediterranean, the fall of the Canal has been
fixed at 0,03 in a 1000 <i>metres</i>, in order to secure a
speed that shall not exceed O <i>m.</i>, 65 per second, and
that shall not destroy the banks of the Canal. This
arrangement will enable us to supply, during the
high waters of the increase, a volume of water for
inundating the lands, of 40 to 50 <i>cubic metres</i> per
second, or 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 <i>cubic metres per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
diem</i>. As the inundation has to be continued during
100 days at the most, and each <i>feddan</i> of land
ought to have a quantity of 8,400 <i>cubic metres</i> of
water, that is to say, two <i>cubic metres</i> of water to
each <i>square metre</i> of land, 47,600 <i>feddans</i> might
thus be inundated during the 100 days. This
quantity of water is given to irrigate the lands and
leave upon them the deposits of the river, or the
mud which is the manure of the Egyptian soil; but
when the lands which the Company will bring into
cultivation have been thus improved by two or three
complete inundations, there will be a greater disposable
quantity of water, and the number of <i>feddans</i>
to be brought into cultivation may be augmented.</p>

<p>The lands being thus fertilised and cultivated in
two ways; first by inundations as we have just said,
afterwards by irrigation during the second part of
the year, that is to say, during the low waters; then
in order to secure sufficient water for the Canal of
which the receipt of water is above the actual low
water, steam machines will be employed at the
backwater of the barrage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to have during the heats of summer a
volume of water that shall be sufficient for the irrigation
of 60,000 <i>feddans</i> (24,000 <i>hectares</i>), for the
loss by evaporation, and the waste at the last locks
of Lake Timsah, there will be required—</p>

<p>The height that the water has to be raised being
2 <i>metres</i>, and a pump of one horse power, raising 60
<i>litres</i> per second for one <i>metre</i>, pumps of five and
six horse power will give the required quantity.</p>

<p>We establish therefore steam pumps of five and
six horse power at the head of the Canal, as well
as a barrage lock with gates both ways, in order to
guard against the great risings of the Nile, and to
retain the waters of the Canal when the river has
subsided.</p>

<p>The Company will thus be able to fertilise 100,000
<i>feddans</i>, of which 60,000 will be by irrigation, and
which will give the richest produce.</p>

<p>The Canal follows the course of the Zafranieh as
far as Tell el Yaoudieh, where there is a lock of 2
<i>met.</i>, 50 fall; it then leaves this ancient water-course
to the left as far as <i>Ras-el-Wady</i>: in this interval
there are three other locks.</p>

<p>Leaving <i>Ras-el-Wady</i>, the track of the Canal is
directed so as to keep it as high as possible, and to
avoid the downs which occupy the whole of the
valley, and are constantly moving from south to
north: all these downs should therefore be fixed by
seed-plots, and their superfice may perhaps be approximately
estimated at 50,000 <i>hectares</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
valley called <i>Wady-Tomilat</i> comprises two quite
distinct parts; the first, from <i>Abasseh-Mollaut</i> to
the east as far as <i>Ras-el-Wady</i>, is well cultivated;
the other from this point, as far as Lake Timsah, is
uncultivated and covered with shrubs, which will
furnish an excellent combustible for the manufacture
of lime and bricks, as well as for the requirements
of the workmen, until it is cultivated. At present
the waters of the Nile spread naturally during the
inundation for half the distance from <i>Ras-el-Wady</i>
to Lake Timsah. The <i>Ras-el-Wady</i> channel extends
along the valley with a depth of 7 <i>metres</i>, and
it opens into Lake Timsah with a double lock, forming
together a fall of 7 metres.</p>

<p>Above this lock there is a water-course for irrigation
running towards Suez, and a conduit of water
on the Charmeroi system which goes towards Pelusium,
so that, for the whole extent of the Isthmus,
there will be water in abundance for the use of the
workmen; the water-course for irrigation is 20
<i>metres</i> wide, 8700 <i>metres</i> in length, and has a fall
of ,04 per <i>kilom.</i>, which gives a difference of 3 <i>met.</i>,
48 in the level.</p>

<p>So that at Suez the water-line of the water-course
will be 7 <i>met.</i>,00 - 3,48 = 3,52. The depth of the
canal being 1,50, it will be seen that its bed will be
2,02 above the level of low water, and near about
that of high water. There will consequently be no
fear of the infiltration of salt water.</p>

<p>The section of the water-course thus determined,
will rule for one-third of its length, but its breadth
will be reduced to 15 <i>metres</i> for a second third, and
to 10 <i>metres</i> for the remaining third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The water-course of Suez follows the direction
and even the bed of the ancient canal, as far as the
Serapeum, the culminating point of the bar of that
name; it then leaves the ancient canal to the east,
to avoid the sands, passes into a solid plain, makes
the circuit of the grand basin of the Isthmus, arrives
at the narrowest part, and continues in the plain at
a sufficient height not to let the fresh water pass
into the low and salt lands.</p>

<p>If on the Pelusiac side, a conduit of water has been
adopted instead of an open water-course, it is in
order to obtain fresh water more quickly for the
whole length of the Maritime Canal, and because the
tillage on the Pelusiac side does not begin until after
that of Suez. And the pipes when they shall be
replaced hereafter by a water-course, will serve to
form a good distribution of water in the town which
will arise at Port Timsah.</p>

<p>The advantages of the undertaking are now demonstrated.
But it is not so with regard to the
returns which it will give to the shareholders. Doubt
is prevalent in the financial world, in consequence
of the widely different estimates made by the engineers,
both as to the cost and the probable returns.
We have therefore directed our investigations more
particularly to this capital point of the question,
taking care to guard against every kind of exaggeration,
in order to arrive at accurate and conscientious
results, and at figures as near as possible to the
truth.</p>

<p>We are now about to present the result of our
investigations in this last part of our labours.</p>

EARTH-WORKS.</h5>

<p>We have adopted in our calculations for the
Canal, the depth of 6 <i>met.</i> 50 below low water,
which will give for the <i>minimum</i> 7 <i>met.</i> 50, and for
the <i>maximum</i> 8 to 9 <i>met.</i> draught of water, by the
disposition of the locks and the elevation of the tides
of the Red Sea. If this figure should not be found
sufficient, it would be easy to increase it by the
dredging machines, a certain number of which will
always be kept, and which would not prevent the
navigation of the Canal.</p>

the first part, we have
similar works executed in Egypt; these
are the three Canals dug to receive the
waters of the Nile arising from the
reflux caused by the barrage. Two
of these canals have a breadth of 100 <i>met.</i> at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
bed; 4 <i>met.</i> 50 mean depth, with banks 25 <i>met.</i>
wide. They are all three dug in clay, which is very
stiff at some points.</p>

<p>The works having been executed by the Government,
the pay of the workmen was very low: 1½
<i>piast.</i> (0 <i>fr.</i> 37½) was given to able workmen; 1
<i>piast.</i> (0 <i>fr.</i> 25) to others, and 30 <i>paras</i> (0 <i>fr.</i> 20)
to children; the corresponding work done was 1
<i>met.</i> 25, cube <i>per diem</i>.</p>

<p>If this ratio were adopted, it would evidently be
too low; for the Company could not, and would not,
exercise such an authority over the people of the
country.</p>

<p>It is true, that these prices are voluntarily accepted
by the fellahs in the villages; but they are
at home with their families, and are able to cultivate
some patches of land on their own account. They
would not willingly leave their families, unless to
obtain higher wages, which would be at the <i>maximum</i>,
2½ <i>piast.</i> (0 <i>fr.</i> 62½).</p>

<p>An average of 2½ <i>piast.</i> (0 <i>fr.</i> 62½) <i>per diem</i>,
must be reckoned upon, not including the supply of
bread and water, which would cost 1 <i>piast.</i> in addition.
Say, therefore, 3½ <i>piast.</i> or in round numbers,
0 <i>fr.</i> 90.</p>

<p>At these wages, with good superintendence, 1 <i>met.</i>
50, cube <i>per diem</i> might be required; for, in the
works which we have carefully observed, we have
adopted the formula 2 + <i>n</i> = 8 <i>met. cub.</i> to fix the
task of the workmen employed. In which formula
<i>n</i> indicates the number of relays of 25 <i>met.</i> In the
present case, supposing the average distance from the
centre of removal to the centre of deposit to be two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
relays, the formula would give 2 <i>met. cub.</i> and moreover
the excavation is to be made in very light ground.
We are therefore sure that the figure 1 <i>met.</i> 50 cube,
is rather below than above the mark. The cubic
metre will thus come to 0 <i>fr.</i> 61.—At this rate the

<h5><span class="smcap">Article II.</span><br />
WORKS OF ART.</h5>

<p>To give a concise but accurate notion of the expense
of the works of art, we shall fix the prime cost
of the materials, compared with the prices paid in
the execution of the works of the barrage, and then
it will be easy to determine the outlay necessary for
the present works, as compared with that of the
former.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Rough Stone.</span>—The rough stone used in the barrage
comes from the quarries of Toura, situated 30 <i>kil.</i>
from the place where it is used. It costs 22 <i>paras</i>
the <i>quintal</i>, or 4 <i>fr.</i>, 20, the <i>cubic metre</i>, delivered
on the spot. That which will be used in the works
of the Maritime Canal will come from the quarries of
Ataka, on the shores of the bay of Suez, at a distance
of 20 <i>kil.</i> from Suez. This being a calcareous stone,
like that of Toura, if it is brought to the boats by a
railroad and towed by steamers, there is sure to be
a saving in the extraction and transport. We have
however, taken the price at 5 <i>fr.</i> to cover all difficulties
in forming establishments, the higher rate of
labour, and the cost of the railroad. This is the
price paid for the blocks employed at the port of
Cherbourg.</p>

<p>At the port of Valencia (in Spain), the extraction
of large blocks, the transport to the quay and loading,
only cost 4 <i>fr.</i> 25.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Hewn Stone.</span>—The hewn stone for the barrage, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
from the quarries of Toura and Massara, at an average
distance of 33 <i>kil.</i> from the place where used.
These stones were first transported a distance of 6
<i>kil.</i> to the banks of the Nile, by means of bullock
carts, then transferred to sailing barges, and carried
by water to the distance above-mentioned.</p>

<p>The price per <i>cubic metre</i> was 24 <i>piast.</i> (6 <i>fr.</i>)
for extraction, and 18 <i>piast.</i> (4 <i>fr.</i> 50) for carriage;
in all 10 <i>fr.</i> 50.</p>

<p>For the works of the Maritime Canal, stone will
be used coming from quarries now in work on the
banks, at the level of high water for the whole extent
of the Gulf of Suez, and also from quarries on
the shore of the Red Sea, at a distance of about 10
<i>kil.</i> from Suez, which furnish a shelly calcareous
stone, soft when extracted, but hardening by exposure
to the air, and also in sea water.</p>

<p>This stone has been successfully employed in building
the Grand Hotel of Suez, and has cost 33 <i>piast.</i>
(8 <i>fr.</i> 25.) the <i>cubic metre</i>, hewn and delivered at
the quay.</p>

<p>We have adopted this price, increased by 60 <i>per
cent.</i> in order to cover the distance, and to arrive
more easily at the comparison which we wish to
establish.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Bricks.</span>—The bricks used in the barrage were made
by steam machines, and cost, on account of extraordinary
circumstances, 26 <i>fr.</i> per thousand. Those
which will be made by hand or by means of bullock
machines in the <i>Wady Tomilat</i>, will not cost half
so much; for they can be made in the whole of that
valley at the rate of 6 to 7 <i>fr.</i> per thousand, on account
of the great quantity of combustibles found in
that locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>We have however assumed, that on account of the
expense of transport, from Pelusium to Suez, the
bricks will come to the same price, as at the barrage,
which is evidently an excess.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Lime.</span>—The lime cost at the barrage, 8 <i>fr.</i> 70 the <i>cubic
metre</i>, delivered on the spot. That which is made
at Suez comes to 7 <i>fr</i>. 75 delivered. This lime is
made in the valley of Guébé, with the combustibles
found there in abundance, and which only cost the
labour of cutting and transport.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Pozzolano.</span>—As the lime used in the barrage was
fat lime, it was necessary to make artificial Pozzolano,
which came to 45 <i>piast.</i> (11 <i>fr.</i> 25) the
<i>cubic metre</i>. This Pozzolano could not be used for
sea work, for we are convinced by experience that
it is affected by the magnesia which is found in sea-water.
It can, therefore, only serve for the works
of the canal of communication, and, like the bricks,
it will cost less than at the barrage.</p>

<p>For the sea masonry, we have happily discovered
solid masses in the harbour of Suez, anciently formed
at the time of the Caliphs, or more probably at that
of the Ptolemies. These masses of masonry are so
compact, that when fragments are detached, the stone
breaks more easily than the mortar, which is simply
composed of sand and hydraulic lime.</p>

<p>This lime very probably comes from the mountains
of Ataka, which contain several beds of calcareous
marl; and there is no doubt that, by making
researches, the beds that supplied the hydraulic lime
may be discovered. Samples have been sent to M.
Leplay, chief engineer and professor at the School
of Mines, for analyzation, and more will be sent
until good beds shall be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>On this supposition, it is more than likely that the
masonry of the Maritime Canal will be less expensive
than that of the barrage, since it will be enough
to have hydraulic lime to mix with the sand, which
is found at all points of the Canal.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Timber.</span>—The timber will come from Anatolia and
Caramania. Oak and fir planks will be procured
from Trieste. These materials will not cost more
than at the barrage; for, though the distance of inland
transport is greater, the expense of trans-shipment
will be avoided by the construction of a new
lock, which will unite the Mahmoudieh Canal, and
consequently the Nile, with the sea.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Iron.</span>—It will be the same with regard to wrought and
cast iron, which will be procured from England and
Russia.</p>

<p>Now, the barrage of the Nile is 1006 <i>metres</i> in
length, with four locks, of which two are double, of
12 <i>metres</i> opening, and two others of 15 <i>metres</i>. It
is established upon a general platform at 7 <i>metres</i>
below the low water, is 46 <i>metres</i> wide, and four
<i>metres</i> average thickness, with two lines of jaunting
piles, and 1600 <i>metres</i> of quay walls, and only cost
18,000,000 <i>francs</i>, including the purchase of steam
machines, to the number of twenty-two, the construction
of all works and all the charges of administration,
which were considerable.</p>

<p>If this amount is divided by the total length of
1006, 17,900 francs will be obtained for the cost of
a running <i>metre</i>, including all the accessories of
locks, quays, machines, and charges of administration.</p>

manner whether the figures which we
exhibit are in conformity with the data
resulting from experience, we have
examined the costs of analogous works,
that we might compare them with
those which we have determined.</p>

<p>The dyke of Cherbourg, which is
3800 <i>met.</i> long, has cost 68,000,000,
after all the vicissitudes it has undergone
from the beginning of the century.
It comes therefore to about
17,900 <i>fr.</i> per running <i>metre</i>. Its
depth is 18 <i>met.</i>, 80 below high water,
while the average depth of those
projected is only 4 <i>met.</i> Now if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
assume, as is evidently correct, that
the bulk, and consequently the cost
of each, are as the square of its
height, we find that as the dyke of
Cherbourg cost 17,900 <i>fr.</i> the running
<i>metre</i>, those of Suez should cost twenty-two
times less, that is 815 <i>fr.</i> yet they
come to 1790 <i>fr.</i> the running <i>metre</i>.</p>

<p>The jetties of the harbour of Joliette
at Marseilles, allowance made for
all expenses, come to 5500 <i>fr.</i> the
running <i>metre</i>. Their foundations
are 11 <i>met.</i>, 50 below low water.
Those of Pelusium ought, therefore,
to cost nine times less, that is 615 <i>fr.</i></p>

<p>The mole of the harbour of Valencia,
which is 560 <i>met.</i> long, and the
foundation 8 <i>metres</i>, 50, deep, was
awarded for a sum of 3,000,000 <i>fr.</i>:
according to this price the defensive
mole of Pelusium should cost less than
that sum, while we have estimated it
at 3,750,000 <i>fr.</i></p>

<p>The mole of the harbour of Cannes,
which is only 150 <i>met.</i> long, has been
estimated at 1,300,000 <i>fr.</i>, which is
8666 <i>fr.</i> per running metre, but it
goes to depths of water that reach 10
<i>met.</i>: its cost is therefore, at least six
times more considerable than that of
the jetties of Suez; yet our estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
is more than the fifth of that figure.</p>

<p>We may therefore say that our estimates
are in excess as regards the
works of Suez, and very much more
so for those of Pelusium, since, in proportion,
our figures exceed even those
of works executed under the most unfavourable

<p>In presenting the estimate of the works, amounting,
as we have seen, to a <i>maximum</i> of 162,550,000
<i>francs</i>, we have been desirous of meeting, on the data
generally admitted, all the objections hitherto made
relative to the difficulties consequent upon the
choking up of the entrance of the jetties and the accretions
in the basin of the Red Sea or in the gulf of Pelusium.
We have been fearful of appearing too bold in
pronouncing, in an absolute manner, in favour of dispensing
with the sluices and the works which they
necessitate. We need not call attention to the fact,
that the present is but a precursory scheme; we reserve
it for our definitive scheme, to examine an
entirely new theory founded on the experience of
the most distinguished engineers of France, and on
the conclusive opinion now before us of M. Renaud,
chief engineer of seaports. We have hopes then,
that it will be possible to dispense with the system
of sluices, and that we shall thus effect an economy
of several millions in the execution of the work.
M. Renaud has ascertained that when the sluices
open into the sea they lose nearly all their efficiency,
and that in many cases they are worse than useless,
and become detrimental. They deposit, in front of
the channel, the matter which they bring down, and
when this matter is not carried off by traversing or
littoral currents, it forms, sooner or later, deposits or
bars, whose summits are above the bed of the channel.
It is thus that the mouths of rivers which flow
into seas without tides, are, with few exceptions,
without depth of water; the alluvium which is carried
along the coasts coming within the action of the current
of the river, is driven by that current to a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
distance from the shore, and deposited in proportion
as the current loses its power. Being then
less easily held in suspension than when near the
coast, where the depth is less, they are also less easily
carried off by the littoral current; deposits are
formed and rise, until the combined action of the
waves and the current no longer permit any fresh
matter to subside.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of this explanation, it
must be admitted that the alluvium brought by the
sea, no less than that brought by rivers, prevents our
obtaining a depth of water at the mouths of those
rivers. Artificial sluices, therefore, appear to have
no power to preserve a permanent depth of water.</p>

<p>If then we are permitted to renounce the idea of
having recourse to the use of sluices for maintaining
the depth of water at Pelusium and at Suez, it will
be very easy by means of dredges to ensure the continuance
of this depth, as is already done at the entrance
of several ports, and particularly at that of
the port of Cette.</p>

<p>The employment of dredges will allow of a considerable
saving in the cost of establishing the Canal.
The portion of the expenses required for the sluices
would certainly be greater than the capital representing
twenty times the annual expense of dredging.</p>

<p>Another saving (of 3,750,000) might be effected
by dispensing with the intended breakwater or defensive
mole at Pelusium. The channel as it is planned
will probably be considered accessible in all winds
which are likely to create a rough sea; there is no
occasion then for us to trouble ourselves with the
fear of seeing ships miss the entrance. There are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
great many important seaports, Alexandria for instance,
where a ship cannot enter after sunset, in a
much worse nautical condition than that at Pelusium
will be, and near which nevertheless there is no
sheltered anchorage. We may name the port of
Liverpool, which is not accessible at low water for
large ships. We may also mention the port of
Havre, into which large ships can only enter during
three hours out of twelve, and yet the number of
disasters on those coasts is not relatively greater
than elsewhere.</p>

<p>We have not deducted from the amount of expenditure
any of the returns, which will be received
during the execution of the works, and which will
not fail to be important:—thus the inland Canal of
communication being finished in the first campaign,
there will be the transport of all the agricultural
produce along it for five years. In the second
year the Canal going as far as Suez, there will be,
for four years, the lock dues and the profits of transport,
which may be valued at an average annual
value of 1,000,000 <i>fr.</i> There will be, moreover, the
profits arising from the cultivation of the lands,
which will increase every year, and will not be of
less average annual value than 1,000,000 <i>fr.</i> This
already makes an income of 8,000,000 <i>fr.</i></p>

<p>Finally, during the last two years, passage may
be afforded, as was done on the Caledonian Canal
to all ships of small tonnage, and to all steam boats
that may choose to take advantage of the cutting,
and in this manner a return of several millions will
be obtained.</p>

<p>We might have brought these sums forward as a deduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
from the interest payable to the shareholders,
but we have preferred leaving them disposable.</p>

<h4>ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUES.</h4>

<p>It is impossible not to recognise <i>à priori</i>, the immense
advantages offered to commerce by the new
route that we present, and it appears from thence
quite natural to assume, that the navigation formerly
carried on in the Red Sea, and which continued to
prosper, notwithstanding the discovery of the Cape,
will resume yet more propitiously the ancient route;
since there will no longer be any trans-shipment, no
longer any transport across the desert, no longer any
obstacle whatever. Steam and sailing vessels will
find, on the contrary, an opportunity of revictualling
in Egypt with fresh provisions, which are found there
in abundance at the lowest prices. Steam vessels
will take in coals there, which will cost less by half
than at present. Finally, travellers who now prefer
the route by the Cape, on account of the inconvenience
of trans-shipment, the fatigues of the desert of
Suez, and the high price of the passage, will no longer
hesitate to adopt the shortest line, when it shall be
more easy, more certain, and more economical than
the other.</p>

<p>There are, however, timorous minds from which
has emanated the opinion, that the Maritime Canal
at the best, could only serve for steam navigation,
for sailing vessels would find, according to them, no
advantage from the moment they should be subjected
to passage dues; and the proof they say, is, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
rate of freightage has sunk so low <i>viâ</i> the Cape, that
it could bear no deduction arising from any passage
dues whatever.</p>

<p>Let us therefore examine the facts attentively, in
order to resolve this question in a manner at once
clear and practical that shall remove all doubts.</p>

<p>In treating of the navigation on the Red Sea, as
compared to that on the ocean, to reach India, we
think we have demonstrated that at present, with the
means of steam-towing, with the aid of lighthouses,
and the knowledge acquired of the winds, the currents,
and the coasts of the Red Sea, a sailing vessel
will meet with more facilities on this latter, than on
the Ocean in the passage of the Cape; but let us
admit the circumstances to be equal on either side,
by way of the Canal 2000 leagues at least are economised
in the passage between Europe and the regions
of the extreme East. This saving is equal to
a saving of two months out of five. For, in making
the passage of 480 leagues from Marseilles to Alexandria,
the ships consume ten days on the average at
the favourable season.</p>

<p>A diminution of two months out of five, must necessarily
produce a corresponding advantage in all
the expenses which press upon merchandize: thus—</p>

<p>1. The average value of imports and exports between
Europe and the extreme East, being about
600 <i>fr.</i> per ton, the saving in the interest, on the
capital employed at the rate of six <i>per cent.</i> will be
6 <i>fr.</i> per ton.</p>

<p>2. A ship of 500 tons burthen, costs at the least,
fully equipped, 150,000 <i>fr.</i>, and pays seven <i>per cent.</i>
<i>per ann.</i> to the assurance companies when it navigates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the Chinese waters. It only makes at present
two voyages in the year including the return; with
the Maritime Canal it will be able to make three,
which will effect a saving to the owner of two <i>per
cent.</i> that is 3000 <i>fr.</i> or 6 <i>fr.</i> per ton.</p>

<p>3. The capital represented by the ship ought to
yield an interest arising from the freight, of at least
twelve <i>per cent.</i> on account of wear and continual
reparation. By enabling the ship to make an additional
voyage, the Canal gives the means of saving
four <i>per cent.</i> that is, 6000 <i>fr.</i> or 12 <i>fr.</i> per ton.</p>

<p>4. This same ship has a crew of fifteen men, exclusive
of the captain. Taking the pay of each man
at 70 <i>fr.</i> per month, and that of the captain at 600
<i>fr.</i>, it will be found that a saving will be made of
2500 <i>fr.</i> which is 5 <i>fr.</i> per ton.</p>

<p>5. Although it may be said that the insurance
upon merchandize is not determined by the duration
of the voyage, but by the risk which the ship runs,
according to the route it takes; we do not the less
persist in maintaining that the facilities of navigation
in the Red Sea being at least equal to those <i>viâ</i>
the Cape, the rate of insurance must be lower upon
merchandize exposed two months less to the chances
of navigation. This rate is usually two and a half
<i>per cent.</i> upon merchandize going to China; we do
not think we are beyond the truth in assuming a
diminution of half <i>per cent.</i> in favour of the passage
by the Canal, which would be a farther saving of 3
<i>fr.</i> per ton.</p>

<p>By adding up the figures thus obtained, we find
a saving of 32 <i>fr.</i> per ton on merchandize which
shall pass by the Canal: this <i>minimum</i> figure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
32 <i>fr.</i> calculated for a diminution of 2,000 leagues;
will increase in proportion to the distance gained by
the ports nearest to the cutting; for Constantinople,
for instance, the saving will be more than double,
on account of the 4300 leagues gained by her navigation.
Leaving 22 <i>fr.</i> of the increased profit to the
advantage of navigation, there will remain 10 <i>fr.</i>
per ton for passage dues in favour of the Company,
a figure which is less than two <i>per cent.</i> on the estimated
average value of the merchandize, at 600 <i>fr.</i>
per ton. Now, silks, indigos, coffees, sugars, tobaccos,
gums, cottons, woollens, wines, spirits, &amp;c. &amp;c. are
of greater value than this figure; there is only rice
and coal which do not reach it.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be objected to our calculations,
that the freights to Australia being on an average
only 50 to 60 <i>fr.</i> per ton on merchandize, if the 32
<i>fr.</i>, which we show as an advantage presented by the
Canal, were forestalled in the freight, there would
only remain 20 to 30 <i>fr.</i> per ton for the shipowner,
who would evidently suffer loss. It will thence be
concluded that our valuations are exaggerated. But
at present the shipowner who despatches his vessel
to Australia at the rate of 60 <i>fr.</i> per ton, is equally
at a loss by the merchandize; and if he consents to
make the speculation, it is for the advantage that
he finds in the freight of the passengers. Well, the
speculation will not be altered by opening the Canal;
the shipowner will still lose on the merchandize and
gain by the passengers: only he will lose less than
at present by the one, and gain more by the other.
It is the same for China and the other parts of the
extreme East. The freights are so low in relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to the distance and the chances of navigation, that
loss appears to result from them. But it is clear
that then the shipowners are interested in those
operations of commerce that are very lucrative, and
are moreover indemnified by the passage of numerous
emigrants, functionaries, &amp;c. &amp;c. The opening
of the Maritime Canal, far from being hurtful to
these operations, will, on the contrary, be eminently
advantageous to them, and the shipowners will find
their ultimate profits increased by it. Our calculations,
therefore, remain intact, since they are based
upon practical data, known to every one, and which
are, moreover, according to the general usages of
commerce.</p>

<p>Let us now endeavour to give an idea of the
commerce in imports and exports, which is carried
on between Europe and India, China, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Trade has so much increased for a period of ten
years, and especially during the last three years, in
consequence of the discovery of gold in Australia;
and every year its developement is such, in relation
to the preceding year, that it is impossible to settle
its statistics even approximately. For the figures
given for one year are already erroneous before they
make their appearance. It is, however, possible to
throw some light upon this question, which has been
the subject of so much controversy, and to give a
<i>minimum</i> figure.</p>

<p>Mac Culloch, in his statistics of 1842, gives the
following figures for the tonnage of merchandize imported
and exported by the commerce of England.</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Anderson gives, probably for the same

Culloch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>We will now compare some of these figures with
those that have been officially collected by M. Arnaud
Tison, delegate from the Chamber of Commerce of
Rouen, in his travels in China during the years
1850-54.</p>

<p>This figure is seven times greater than that given
by Mr. Mac Culloch, and as the discovery of gold
was not yet made at that time, it may be said that
at present the figure given by M. Arnaud Tison
ought to be doubled to be correct. The total value
of imports and exports was 110,000,000.</p>

<p>For China, the single port of Shang-Hai exported
in 1851, 35,000 tons of tea, which is more than the
figure given by Mr. Mac Culloch for all the produce
imported from China.</p>

<p>The commerce of the two single ports of Shang-Hai
and Canton, in imports and exports, without
reckoning opium, was estimated in 1851 at 400 to
500,000,000 <i>francs</i>, which answers nearly to 800,000
tons, taking the average value per ton at 600 <i>fr.</i>,
and which makes twelve times as much as the estimate
given by Mr. Mac Culloch.</p>

<p>At Manilla, the commerce in 1851 was 51,773,232
<i>fr.</i> of which about 24,000,000 were exports, and
the remainder imports. This figure answers to
the activity of 86,300 tons, taking the average value
of the ton at 600 <i>fr.</i> It is more than twenty times
the estimate of Mr. Mac Culloch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>For Java we have not been able to procure any
positive information, but according to the periodical
publications (<i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>) and according
to the reports of travellers, the increase of
business every year is much greater than in the Philippine
Islands. We shall not therefore be charged
with exaggeration, in fixing the figure of commercial
activity in these colonies at 100,000,000 or
about 150,000 tons, for the year 1851.</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson estimated the commerce between
Europe and Indo-China at £26,000,000, or
650,000,000 <i>francs</i>, thus distributed:—</p>

<table class="n">

    <td colspan="2">Amount of the commerce with places to the east of Egypt</td>
    <td class="tdr bt bb">£26,000,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We have just seen from the researches of M.
Arnaud Tison that Shang-Hai and Canton alone
gave to commerce in 1851 an activity represented
by the figure of 400 to 500,000,000 <i>francs</i>, which is
quadruple that attributed by Mr. Anderson in 1841,
to the entire commerce of the China Seas, including
the Philippine islands, Java and Singapore.</p>

<p>We are therefore quite sure of being below the
reality in fixing the amount of commerce with places
to the east of Egypt, in 1851 at 100,000,000, instead
of the 26,000,000 in 1841. At the time we
write, this figure of 100,000,000 sterling is perhaps
quadrupled and carried to 10,000,000,000 francs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and when the Canal is opened, this latter sum will
be a mere mistake.</p>

<p>In fact not only the greatest part of the commerce
of Europe with the extreme East will be carried on
through the Maritime Canal, but moreover all the
activity in operation between America and China,
will abandon the route of Cape Horn for that of the
Isthmus, which will be easier, shorter, and more
certain.</p>

<p>For the farther support of our opinion, we have
the vast countries which are at present completely
without the sphere of the commercial activity of the
world, and which, upon the opening of the Canal,
will furnish a contingent which cannot be estimated
now, but which will be considerable. Abyssinia,
Yemen, Hedjaz, Mascata, and the coasts of Africa,
will deliver quantities of merchandize; such as the
coffee of Yemen and Abyssinia, gum arabic, wax,
skins, ivory, wool, indigo, &amp;c. &amp;c. Mules and animals
for the slaughterhouse abound in Abyssinia,
and are sold at a low price. A mule may be had
from 25 to 100 <i>fr.</i>, an ox for 10 <i>fr.</i>, a sheep for 3 <i>fr.</i>;
timber and cabinet woods abound in the vast forests
which have never felt the axe. Along the coasts of
the Red Sea are very rich mines of sulphur, which
have just begun to be worked; lead mines, quarries
of marble and porphyry; extended beaches suitable
for the establishment of salt pits, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>New occupations will arise, such as whale and
cachalot fishing in the South Seas; pearl fishing in
the Persian Gulf and Indian Sea, as well as the
pursuit of mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell and coral.
A great part of the Mediterranean fishermen will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
transport themselves to the Indian Sea, to pursue
their occupation, and increase the activity of the
navigation in the Maritime Canal.</p>

<p>We may therefore be sure that the cutting through
of the Isthmus will increase ten-fold the operations
of commerce and navigation; that, as with every
undertaking based upon a true principle, the consequences
cannot be calculated, and that the idea
most exaggerated in appearance, will always be surpassed
by the reality.</p>

<p>As, however, we are addressing ourselves to the
commercial world, and have to convince all minds,
even the most timid, it is necessary that we should
fix upon a figure, and that this figure should not
startle any one. We have adopted that of 4 milliards
(4,000,000,000) of francs, answering to 6,000,000
tons, which, according to what we have been showing,
is without doubt, already exceeded at present, or certainly
will be, before the close of the undertaking.</p>

<p>We have likewise assumed that of the 6,000,000
tons, 3,000,000 only will take the route of the
Canal.</p>

<p>If we had followed the method of estimating
adopted in the railway schemes, it would be necessary
to make a statement of all the merchandize exchanged
between Europe and America on the one
part, and Indo-China on the other; then to multiply
the figure thus obtained by a coefficient, never less
than 3, and which sometimes reaches to 10. The
result of this operation would give an enormous
product, nevertheless probable. But to remain
within the circle of ordinary ideas, instead of tripling
the actual figures, we have diminished them by
half.</p>

and above the interest of five <i>per cent.</i>, taking the
capital at 200,000,000 <i>fr.</i></p>

<p>We pass over in silence a multitude of sources of
revenue, which will not fail to be pretty considerable;
such as the supply of water to the population of Suez
and Port Timsah, the rent of stations for watering
ships, the rent of all the magazines and buildings,
which have been employed in the execution of the
Canal, the towing of vessels by the steamers purchased
by the Company for the service of the dredges
and the transport of materials.</p>

<p>There are other branches of revenue that will acquire
great importance hereafter; among others, the
fishing in the Canal, the produce of the works to be
established at the fall of each barrage lock, and the
sale of Arab horses.</p>

<p>The current established by the action of the two
barrage locks, will draw into the Canal a multitude
of fish, both from the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The falls of the fresh water Canal will be made
available to the agricultural operations of the country,
such as grinding corn, husking of cotton, peeling of
flax, laying of thread, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The situation of the Isthmus of Suez, upon the
confines of Arabia and Syria, which supply the best
breeds of horses, and whither Europe has always had
to repair to regenerate the equine species, will become
a locality, than which none can be more favourable
for the formation and maintenance at a trifling
expense, of an establishment for breeding and rearing
horses. The valley <i>Wady Tomilat</i> will again become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
what it was in the times of Scripture, the land of
<i>Goshen</i>, which name signifies in Hebrew and Arabic
<i>Pastures</i>; the land that Joseph prevailed upon
Pharaoh to grant to the Israelites, <i>because it was the
most fertile country in Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>We are so convinced that the preceding estimates
of revenue will be rapidly exceeded, that we propose
to the Company to have a clause inserted in the
Statutes by which the tariffs shall be lowered as soon
as the dividends shall exceed twenty <i>per cent.</i>, in
order to make the community of the world participators
in the advantages of this grand and useful
undertaking.</p>

<p>With this last observation we will terminate our
labours, which are only, as their title indicates, a
preparatory work, intended to fix public opinion
upon the merits of the undertaking, and to lead discussion
on to a limited and well defined ground.</p>

<p>These labours will be followed by a regular scheme,
wherein all the details of execution will be developed,
and wherein the most recent statistical documents,
drawn from official sources, will furnish the basis of
all the calculations of revenue.</p>

<p>We have confined ourselves in this preliminary
exposition to the establishment of the approximate
<i>maximum</i> presumed expenditure, and we have sought
to guard against any exaggeration in estimating the
revenue. All our calculations are based upon documents,
which any one may verify and appreciate
at their worth.</p>

<p>We entertain the hope, that the undertaking will
be favourably received, for there will be profit and
honour for those who take the first part in it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
it will not only offer incontestable advantages, but
it will be moreover the grandest work of progress
and of civilization that the nineteenth century will
have produced.</p>

<p>Your very humble servant has the honour to address
you as follows:—</p>

<p>M. Ferd. de Lesseps is about to return to your
Highness. He is indeed, as your Highness was
graciously pleased to observe to us, a guest who of
himself deserves all possible attention and consideration.
His object in coming here had reference to
the affair of the Canal; an undertaking of the most
useful character. During his stay in Constantinople,
I have had the pleasure of seeing him several times,
and of conversing with him at length on various subjects.
He has had the honour of being presented to
his Majesty the Sultan, by whom he was received
with the highest favour.</p>

<p>In conformity with the Imperial order on the subject
of the Canal, the question of this interesting
undertaking is now under the consideration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Council of Ministers. M. de Lesseps, not being
able to wait until the end of the conferences, has

have to acquaint your Highness in detail with the
result.</p>

<p class="right">The Camp, Marea, 30th April, 1855.</p>

<p>I had the honour of submitting to your Highness
the memorial of your Engineers MM.
Linant <i>Bey</i>, and Mougel <i>Bey</i>, for the construction
of the Canal of the Isthmus of Suez.</p>

<p>This is intended as a precursory scheme for the
cutting through the Isthmus. It is accompanied by
a map indicating the configuration of the ground and
the nature of the soil. It has met with your Highness’
approval, and you have requested me to give it
the most extensive publicity in order to call the attention
of all competent persons in Europe and
America to a question which interests the whole world,
and to invite their examination and observations.</p>

<p class="center">...</p>

<p>Your Highness has decided to send immediately,
to the Counsellors of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan,
the explanations which they require for the
ratification of the scheme for the communication of
the two Seas.</p>

<p>For my own part I shall proceed immediately to
Europe, I shall make it my especial business to get
the official documents relative to the affair as well
as the precursory scheme of MM. Linant Bey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Mougel Bey, printed and published. Arrangements
will be made in order to collect within a limited time
the opinions of those competent persons who shall
be willing to aid the enterprise with their information
and suggestions. In the mean time your engineers
will be preparing the elements of their definitive
scheme.</p>

<p>Agents will be appointed in every country to collect
the communications and arrange the correspondence.</p>

<p>When the definitive scheme of the engineers is
completed, and when the remarks received from each
country have furnished a mass of information, a
commission will be appointed, composed of engineers
of known ability in hydraulic operations, and chosen
in England, France, Germany, Italy and Holland.
This commission will give its opinion upon the
scheme of your Highness’ Engineers, and point out
the modifications, or alterations which it shall think
proper to be adopted. Every means shall be placed
at the disposal of the Commission for visiting the
Isthmus of Suez, should it be considered necessary
to see the localities before deciding.</p>

<p>Your Highness has been pleased to limit at present
the consideration of the track. After having passed
in review the numerous schemes presented to Governments,
or to the public, for more than fifty years,
you give full liberty for the application of the means
that science shall recognize to be best for making a
communication between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean,
by cutting through the Isthmus of Suez
at any point of the Isthmus, eastward of the course
of the Nile; but you have declared that you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
not authorize the Grand Maritime Suez Canal Company
to adopt any track that might have its point of
departure on the coast of the Mediterranean eastward
of the Damietta branch, and which would cross
the Nile.</p>

<p>It will not be until after the adoption of the track
of communication between the two Seas, and when
all the advantages and all the responsibilities of those
who take part in the enterprise are clearly determined,
that capitalists and the public will be invited
to subscribe for shares, and the representatives of
those interested will finally decide upon all questions
affecting the administration, the execution and carrying
out of the undertaking.</p>

<p>Allow me now to point out to your Highness, the
preparatory operations to which MM. Linant <i>Bey</i>
and Mougel <i>Bey</i> have to apply themselves previous
to presenting their definitive scheme.</p>

<p>They have—</p>

<p>1st. To trace out on the ground the line of the
Maritime Canal in detail, with all its angles and
curves, and transfer the line so traced on to a plan.</p>

<p>2nd. To take the levels throughout this line, extending
them into the two Seas to a depth of ten
<i>metres</i> of water.</p>

<p>3rd. To make profile sections wherever the formation
of the ground requires it.</p>

<p>4th. To take soundings along the line, and carry
them out to a depth of ten <i>metres</i> below the level of
low water in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>5th. To collect specimens of the various soils met
with in their operations.</p>

<p>6th. To settle the prime cost of manual labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and of all the materials that will be employed in the
construction of the Canal.</p>

<p>7th. To establish positive data that will serve to
estimate the number of workmen of all kinds necessary
for the execution of the works.</p>

<p>For my own part, I shall make it my business to
collect the most recent statistical documents that
will afford the means of ascertaining positively the
<i>minimum</i> valuation of the returns.</p>

<p>When the time has arrived for commencing the
works of the Maritime Canal, a large number of
machines, and a considerable quantity of materials,
timber, iron, coal, &amp;c. &amp;c., ought to be procured
from Europe. The Suez Canal Company will find
the advantages of certainty, economy and facility of
transport, which do not exist at present, in the continuation
of the railway to Suez, and the establishment
of the Towing Society, with which is connected
the amelioration of the Mahmoudieh Canal, and
also its communication with the port of Alexandria.</p>

<p class="center">...</p>

<p>The communications which I have received from
Europe bear witness to the ever-increasing interest
with which the scheme of opening the Isthmus of Suez
is everywhere received.</p>

<p>Amongst those who have spontaneously offered me
their co-operation, there are some who have placed
considerable sums at my disposal as a contribution
to the preliminary expenses of the undertaking.
These offers already amount to more than 15,000,000
francs. I have not thought it proper to avail myself
of them, but I have noted the names of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
who have made them in order that they may take
their appropriate place in the list of subscribers.</p>

<p>Certain founding members have already been
named; they have subscribed an engagement, under
conditions, to contribute to the expenses preliminary
to the regular organization of the Company. The
first list of founding members, fulfilling the conditions
required by Art. 11, of your Highness’s Firman,
contains fifty-five names belonging both to Egypt
and to Europe. Your Highness who leaves to me
the charge of completing this list by the addition of
persons of all countries who shall actually contribute
to the establishment of the work, has desired that
the total number should not exceed 100 if it can be
avoided.</p>

<p>Your Highness has been pleased to approve of the
provisional appointment of M. Ruyssenaers, Consul
General of the Netherlands, as principal agent of
the Company in Egypt; he deserves in every respect
this mark of confidence.</p>

<p>Such are the preliminary proceedings that have
appeared to your Highness calculated to promote the
success of your grand enterprise.</p>

<p>I beg your Highness to inform me whether I have
fully understood your intentions.</p>

OPINION OF MR. ANDERSON.</span></h2>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<h3>OPINION OF MR ANDERSON.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h3>

<p>The interest which has recently been manifested
in the improvement of our means of communication
with India, China, &amp;c. <i>viâ</i> Egypt and the
Red Sea, seems to have revived the speculations,
first broached during the occupation of Egypt by the
French forces under Napoleon, as to the feasibility
of opening a communication between the Red Sea
and the Mediterranean by a Canal through the
Isthmus of Suez.</p>

<p>Various statements upon this subject have lately
appeared in the newspapers and periodicals, both of
this country and the Continent, and a kind of prospectus
proposing the formation of a Company to
execute the undertaking, has just been put in circulation
in London.</p>

<p>These statements and speculations, in so far as
they have come under the cognizance of the writer
of the following pages, are, in a great measure, superficial,
crude, or erroneous,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and, therefore, calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to mislead rather than inform the public in
regard to the practicability and utility of an enterprise,
whose importance it is scarcely possible to
overrate, considering the nature and magnitude of the
interests which would be involved in its successful
accomplishment.</p>

<p>The writer has had the means of obtaining information
relative to this matter, which he considers
may be relied on, and having devoted much of his
attention to this Canal question, he deems the present
time opportune for submitting to the public
some facts and observations tending, he ventures to
believe, to lead to more correct conclusions on this
very interesting subject than any which have as yet
been published.</p>

<p>These facts and observations will be found arranged
under the following heads:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1.—<i>The physical practicability of the enterprise.</i></p>

<p>2.—<i>The political arrangements requisite for
effecting it.</i></p>

<p>3.—<i>The advantages or disadvantages of navigating
by the proposed Canal route, as
compared with the route by the Cape of
Good Hope.</i></p>

<p>4.—<i>Financial considerations.</i></p>

<p>5.—<i>General observations as to the political, commercial,
and moral benefits which would be
derived from the accomplishment of the
undertaking.</i></p>

</div>

<p>That facility of intercourse creates commerce, and
commerce carries with it civilization, is an axiom
founded on universal experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Where seeming exceptions to it are found, they
may be traced to the blind selfishness of human
legislation, counteracting the natural laws established
by the all-wise and beneficent Governor of the universe.</p>

<p>A project, therefore, which, by severing two continents,
proposes to change the whole course of commerce
and communication between the eastern and
western worlds, and approximate by many thousand
miles the knowledge and industry of the west to the
ignorance and barbarism of the east, presents considerations
of a nature to excite the imagination, and
to awaken some of our best feelings in its favour.</p>

<p>In dealing with it, the writer, however, purposes
to limit himself to a strictly practical view of the
subject. He will state his facts with accuracy,—place
every circumstance, whether for or against the
undertaking, as far as his information enables him
to judge, impartially before the reader,—and thus
leave him to form his own opinion as to the practicability
of accomplishing the contemplated enterprise,
and of its utility should it be accomplished.</p>

<p>The writer deems it proper to add, that the matter
was some time since submitted by him to the consideration
of Her Majesty’s Government, and that the
extract from M. Linant’s Survey of the Isthmus,
herein given, appears in the “<i>Commercial Tariffs,
Regulations, &amp;c., of Foreign Countries, part 10,
presented to both Houses of Parliament, by command
of Her Majesty, 14th July, 1843</i>,” being part
of those valuable compilations, for which it is well
known the country is indebted to the talents and
industry of Mr. Macgregor, of the Board of Trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Physical practicability of the Enterprise.</span></h4>

<p>The improvement of our communication with the
East has been, for some time past, an object of much
public solicitude, and in proportion to the progress
made in its developement, its importance becomes
more and more manifest. The establishment of a
steam communication with India, &amp;c., <i>viâ</i> the Mediterranean
and the Red Sea, although as yet only
in its infancy, has already been productive of considerable
benefit, both to Great Britain and her
Oriental dependencies.</p>

<p>But, although the steam communication presents
a greatly improved means of transit by this route for
passengers and letters, it cannot, except in a comparatively
very limited degree, be made available
for the general purposes of commerce. The transport
of all articles of merchandize of moderate value,
compared to their bulk or weight, must, from the
small stowage-room afforded by steam vessels, and
the expense of the transit across Egypt, continue to
be effected by means of sailing vessels navigating by
the long and circuitous route round the Cape of Good
Hope.</p>

<p>The principal object, therefore, of the contemplated
Canal, would be to open a shorter route between
Europe and the East, which could be availed
of by sailing as well as by steam vessels, and thus
serve the general purposes of commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>Previously to proceeding to treat of the practicability
of opening such a canal, it may be proper to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
explain how it has fallen to my lot to deal with this
subject:—</p>

<p>In the year 1841, I visited Egypt. While there,
my attention was, among other matters, directed to
the question which has so frequently been mooted,
although never hitherto, I think, satisfactorily treated,
viz. the practicability of re-opening the ancient
Canal through the Isthmus of Suez, said to have once
joined the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In following up this object, I became acquainted
with M. Adolphe Linant, of Cairo, a French Civil
Engineer, of considerable reputation, and who has
been in the employ of the Pacha of Egypt, for, I believe,
upwards of twenty years.</p>

<p>I found that M. Linant had devoted a great deal
of time and labour to the practical investigation of this
subject, had recently completed an elaborate survey
of the Isthmus, and was in possession of much
detailed information derived from a personal examination
of the localities through which the proposed
Canal would have to be cut. Under certain conditions
I induced him to furnish me with a memoir on
the subject, accompanied by a manuscript map of
his Survey of the Isthmus of Suez, and of Lower
Egypt, in which the site of the ancient and track of
the proposed Canal are laid down with great minuteness.
In short, the map, now in my possession,
which is on a large scale, contains a far more complete
view of Lower Egypt than any hitherto executed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Political Arrangements.</span></h4>

<p>The co-operation, or, at least, the concurrence of
the Pacha of Egypt would be indispensable.</p>

<p>Having suggested the expediency of the interposition
of one or more of the European powers to remove
any political impediments which might stand
in the way of this enterprise, it appears necessary to
take a brief view of the interest which they would
each have in promoting it.</p>

<p><i>Great Britain</i>, from the vast extent of her commerce
and political connections with the East, would,
undoubtedly, derive the greatest advantage from it;
but most of the other nations of Europe would derive
benefit in proportion to the extent of their commerce;
and those, having ports in the Mediterranean
and Levant, or indeed anywhere nearer to the
proposed communication than the ports of Great
Britain, would gain more in proportion.</p>

<p><i>Holland</i>, next to Great Britain, would, from the
extent of her trade with the East, have a direct interest
in the accomplishment of the proposed enterprise.
Her commerce would be improved, and her
political connection with her extensive colonies of
Java, &amp;c., would be much strengthened by it.</p>

<p><i>France</i> would derive most important benefits. It
would create almost a new commerce for her, in
which, through her ports in the Mediterranean, she
would have the advantage over us in importing direct
the indigo, &amp;c., of India, of which she requires
such large quantities for the use of her manufactories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
while the shorter route which would be opened
to India, &amp;c., would give a stimulus to her exports.</p>

<p><i>Austria</i>, there is every reason to believe, would
give a cordial support to the undertaking. She is
making active and judicious efforts to extend and
improve her commerce; and there is little doubt of
her co-operation in promoting an undertaking so well
calculated to further her views in that respect. The
merchants of Trieste have been the first to avail
themselves of an arrangement which the writer of
this succeeded about two years since in effecting with
the Pacha of Egypt, by which he agreed to relinquish
the high rate of transit duties in Egypt, imposed by
the treaties with the Porte, and to substitute as low
a rate of duty as would admit of the transit through
Egypt of goods to and from India, &amp;c. Under this
arrangement, two cargoes of India produce have
been already brought from Bengal to Suez in sailing
vessels, thence transported across Egypt to Alexandria,
whence they were brought to Trieste.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Commerce of that port are, it is
well known, anxious to extend their trade with the
East in this direction; and it is stated, that a proposal
was, a short time since, made by some Austrian
capitalists to the Pacha, for opening a Canal
through the Isthmus.</p>

<p><i>Greece</i> would obtain a decided benefit by it. Her
numerous small vessels would be well adapted for
trading with the ports of Africa and Arabia in the
Red Sea, and they would soon be seen covering
these coasts.</p>

<p>Italy, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the
minor northern states, and even America, would all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
participate more or less in the improved route for
eastern commerce, and, taking a just view of their
own interests, would hail it as a benefit.</p>

<p>Even <i>Russia</i>, although possessed of an over-land
communication with Central Asia, India, and China,
would gain an advantage by the Canal, as she could
open a maritime intercourse with the east through
her ports in the Black Sea, which would be less
costly, and susceptible of greater extension than a
land transit.</p>

<p>It hence appears, that all the European powers
would have an interest, more or less, in promoting
this enterprise; and there appears to be reasonable
grounds for concluding, that if requested by one or
more of the first-rate powers, either to undertake
the work himself, or permit it to be undertaken by
private capitalists, under such an arrangement as
would connect his name with it, and secure to himself
and his descendants a pecuniary benefit from it,
as already suggested, Mehemet Ali would be induced
to co-operate in it.</p>

<p>The guardianship of such a passage between
Europe and the East, would serve to enhance the
importance of his political position, and to strengthen
those relations of mutual interest between the ruler
of Egypt, and the communities of Europe, which
would form the most efficacious guarantee for the
continuance of the Government of Egypt in the
family of Mehemet Ali.</p>

<p>The association of his name with so magnificent
an enterprise, would, I consider, be another powerful
motive to a man so ardently imbued with the
love of fame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Should a firman or other formal act from the
Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in his character of
sovereign of the soil, be deemed requisite for securing
a permanent and indisputable right to make
and keep open the Canal, I should suggest that
point being left to the management of the Pacha,
who, I have some reason to think, would obtain it
much more easily and promptly than if it were attempted
through the medium of European diplomacy.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Advantages of navigating by the canal route,
as compared with the route by the Cape of
Good Hope.</span></h4>

<p>Before entering on a comparison of these two
routes with regard to their navigation by sailing
vessels, it may be well to consider what advantages
the contemplated Canal would afford in facilitating
the steam communication with the East <i>viâ</i> Egypt
and the Red Sea, commonly, though very erroneously,
denominated “the Overland Route.”</p>

<p>In order to make this properly understood, it will
be necessary to give a brief account of the present
arrangements for the transit through Egypt of the
mails, passengers, and packages, to and from India,
China, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is, no doubt, generally known, that this communication
is carried on by the steamers of a private
Company, which ply monthly between Southampton
and Alexandria, touching at Gibraltar and Malta,
and by smaller steamers belonging to the East India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Company, which ply monthly between Bombay and
Suez, chiefly for the purpose of conveying the mails.
The private Company have now also placed two
steam ships, the “Hindostan,” and the “Bentinck,”
of 1800 tons, and 520 horse power each, to ply between
Suez and Calcutta, touching at Aden, Ceylon,
and Madras. The vessels of that Company,
both on this side of Egypt, as well as on the other
side, convey goods as well as passengers, and the
mails; but the East India Company’s vessels plying
between Suez and Bombay, do not receive goods,
and have but limited, and comparatively inferior
accommodations for passengers.</p>

<p>The mails, passengers, and packages, are, of
course, disembarked from the steamers coming from
England at Alexandria, and are re-embarked at
Suez in the steamers proceeding to India on the
outward route, and <i>vice versâ</i> on the homeward
route.</p>

<p>It now remains to show how their transit across
Egypt, between Alexandria on the Mediterranean,
and Suez on the Red Sea, is effected, with the present
cost of it, in order to estimate how far it would
be improved by the contemplated Canal communication.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to consider what advantages
the Canal would present to sailing vessels navigating
between Europe and the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>This is, of course, assuming the navigation by the
Mediterranean and Red Sea route to be of equal
facility with the Cape route. And I shall now endeavour
to examine this part of the question with the
accuracy which its importance demands.</p>

<p>The first point which presents itself in this consideration,
is the influence of the monsoons, or periodical
winds, which prevail throughout the Indian
Seas, and in the southern part of the Red Sea.</p>

<p>The south-west monsoon, which blows much
stronger than the north-east monsoon, prevails in the
Indian Ocean, between the east coast of Africa and
the coasts of India, &amp;c., from May until October,
blowing with the greatest force during the months of
June, July, and August.</p>

<p>The north-east monsoon prevails from October to
May, but is of much less force than the south-west
monsoon.</p>

<p>In order to estimate the difficulties or advantages
of these periodical winds, to a sailing vessel navigating
by the Red Sea, as compared with the route
by the Cape of Good Hope, we must, for vessels
bound to or from the most important commercial
ports in India—the Presidencies of Madras and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Bengal, as also Ceylon, Singapore, Java, China, &amp;c.,
suppose her placed at a point a few degrees to the
southward of Ceylon from or to which she would
have to proceed, whether navigating by the Cape of
Good Hope, or by the Red Sea route.</p>

<p>Now, it is well known, that from this position a
vessel steering for the coast of Africa towards Cape
Guardafui (the southern extremity of the Gulf of
Aden), and thence to the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb
(the entrance of the Red Sea), would carry the wind
a-beam, and could therefore make her passage to or
from the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the given
point to the southward of Ceylon, during the whole
of the south-west monsoon.</p>

<p>As the north-east monsoon blows in an exactly
opposite direction to the south-west monsoon, and is
much more moderate, a sailing vessel could make
good her course between the Red Sea and the same
point south of Ceylon, equally well as in the south-west
monsoon, and therefore during the whole year
could effect this part of the passage with tolerable
certainty.</p>

<p>Vessels proceeding to or from Bombay would have
to arrange their passages to suit the monsoons. Sailing
from England, or other places in Europe, so as
to have the south-west monsoon in their favour; and
sailing from Bombay for Europe so as to have the
north-east monsoon in their favour.</p>

<p>It hence appears that the monsoons present no
particular difficulties in the voyage between India, &amp;c.
and the entrance of the Red Sea, more than in the
ordinary route by the Cape of Good Hope; but that,
on the contrary, for ships trading with the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and most important parts of Hindostan, and to Ceylon,
Malacca, Singapore, Java, China, &amp;c. this part of
the voyage would be made with more certainty than
an equal distance in the Indian Ocean, of a voyage
by the Cape of Good Hope route.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Red Sea Passage.</span></h4>

<p>The length of the Red Sea from the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb
to Suez is 1200 miles, its medium breadth
about 150 miles, and its direction nearly N. N. W.
and S. S. E.</p>

<p>Its coasts on either side are fringed with coral
rocks, which render it dangerous in navigating it to
approach near its shores.</p>

<p>In the southern part of it, say from the latitude of
Jidda to Bab-el-Mandeb, being about one-half of its
whole length, the southerly monsoon predominates
nearly two-thirds of the year, commencing in October
and ending in May or June. The northerly winds
then set in, and continue about four months, say June,
July, August, and September.</p>

<p>Outside the Red Sea, in the Gulf of Aden, the wind
generally prevails from the eastward for six months,
say, from October to May, and from the westward
during the other part of the year.</p>

<p>In the northern part of the sea, from Jidda to
Suez, but more particularly near to Suez, the prevailing
winds for nine months of the year are northerly,
and in the months of June, July, and August,
it is very difficult for sailing vessels to beat up to
Suez. In this part of the Red Sea southerly breezes
are at all times but of short duration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The best time for vessels to sail from Suez for
India, &amp;c. is therefore about the end of August,
which will enable them to clear the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb
in September, before the easterly winds
commence in the Gulf outside.</p>

<p>From all these facts it will appear,</p>

<p>1st. That the passage between India, &amp;c., and
the Gulf of Aden, may be made with ordinary facility
by sailing vessels.</p>

<p>2nd. That some delay would be experienced by
sailing vessels in the Gulf of Aden during certain
portions of the year, whether bound to or from
India; and also by vessels <i>coming from India</i>, in the
northern part of the Red Sea, during the greater
part of the year.</p>

<p>Against these difficulties in the Red Sea route
must, however, be set off the delays by calms and
contrary winds, between the trades experienced by
vessels navigating by the Cape route. In order to
ascertain how nearly they may balance each other,
and consequently whether a saving of time in navigating
by the Mediterranean and Red Sea, proportionate
to the shorter distance, as compared with the
voyage round the Cape of Good Hope, might be
effected, I would beg leave to submit the following
questions to the consideration of experienced nautical
men.</p>

<p>1st. Is the navigation by a sailing vessel, between
England and Pelusium, say 3000 miles, of
equal facility as a similar distance from England on
the Cape route?</p>

<p>2nd. Is the navigation to or from the given point,
to the southward of Ceylon and Cape Guardafui,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
more certain than that of an equal distance between
the same point and the Cape of Good Hope?</p>

<p>3rd. Would the impediments in the navigation
of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, already pointed
out, be greater or less than those experienced from
calms and contrary winds between the trades in navigating
by the Cape of Good Hope route? And,
assuming that the answer to the second query should
be in favour of the Red Sea route, would that gain
set off against the difficulties of navigating the Red
Sea and Gulf of Aden, and reduce the latter to a
par with the impediments between the trades just
alluded to?</p>

<p>4th. Would not the nature of the coast of Egypt,
at the embouchure of the Canal in the Mediterranean,
present considerable difficulty and danger to
sailing vessels approaching it for the purpose of
seeking the Canal entrance? The coast, it is well
known, for a distance of upwards of 150 miles to the
eastward, as well as to the westward of the Canal
entrance, is destitute of any sheltered anchorage,
is exceedingly low, and not easily discoverable until
within a short distance of it, and very shallow at a
distance of two leagues from the shore. A good
light on the pier or breakwater might obviate some
of the danger, but still it is to be apprehended, that
sailing vessels approaching this part of the coast,
with the wind strong from the north and north-west,
and which is very prevalent, would incur considerable
risk of getting embayed and being driven
ashore.</p>

<p>If the result of this investigation should be such
as to place the difficulties and facilities of each route
on a par, it will then follow that a gain in time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
from four to six weeks would be effected in navigating
to or from India, &amp;c. by the proposed Canal,
as compared with the Cape of Good Hope route.</p>

<p>Before concluding this part of the subject, I think
it well to advert to another objection which may
possibly be raised against the Canal passage, namely,
the difficulty of tracking a vessel of heavy burthen
through the Canal, from the Mediterranean to the
Red Sea, against a current of three to four miles
an hour, which would be the velocity of the stream
constantly flowing from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>To this may be answered, that the same northerly
winds which prevail as already stated, for the greater
part of the year, in the upper or northern part of
the Red Sea, also blow across the Isthmus, and consequently
the vessel would be for the most part able
to stem the current by using her sails. In default
of this, a sufficient number of dromedaries would
track a vessel of almost any size, or posts placed
along the banks of the Canal for warping would
effect the object on occasions, which would be of but
rare occurrence, of a failure of wind.</p>

<p>It is to be considered also, that as the beds of the
Bitter Lakes and of the Lake Timsah, would form
two very extensive basins in the course of the Canal,
nearly half-way between the Mediterranean and the
Red Sea, these would become halting places or inland
ports, and here steam tugs would no doubt,
among other accessories, be found, should the Canal
ever become a general channel of intercourse.</p>

<p><i>From</i> the Red Sea <i>to</i> the Mediterranean the vessel
would, of course, be carried along by the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">General Observations as to the Political, Commercial,
and Moral Benefits which would
be derived from the Accomplishment of the
Undertaking.</span></h4>

<p>In a political point of view, the facilities which
the Canal passage, combined with steam navigation,
would afford to Great Britain, as regards the government
of her Indian empire and dependencies,
are almost incalculable.</p>

<p>From Malta troops could be placed in Bombay in
<i>three weeks</i>; in Ceylon and Madras in four weeks;
and in Calcutta in five weeks. And by means of
the frequent intermediate coast communication in
India, which the extended and comprehensive plan
of steam navigation anticipated to result from the
opening of the Canal passage would afford, troops
and stores could be rapidly moved from one station
to another.</p>

<p>Let any military man compare this with the present
mode of effecting similar operations. The long
sea voyage by the Cape of Good Hope, of four or
five months, in a sailing vessel;—the men worn out,
and requiring almost as many months more after debarkation,
to recruit their health and strength, so as
to be fit for active duty;—the length of time, and great
fatigue, in moving between distant military stations;—and
I think he will admit, that India might, with
the facility alluded to, be efficiently governed with
one-half the number of European troop which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
now required. The facility for despatching ships
of war, and stores of all kinds, to or from India, &amp;c.,
need only be glanced at to be at once appreciated.
The stability of British power in India would be
thus increased, while the cost of maintaining it would
be considerably diminished.</p>

<p>To estimate the importance of the proposed communication
in a commercial point of view, it is necessary
to take into consideration the extent of the
field of operations for commerce, which the vast and
populous regions of the East present. India contains
100,000,000 of subjects of the British Crown,
and there are 50,000,000 of adjacent tributaries and
allies; in all, 150,000,000 in the Peninsula of Hindostan,
exclusive of the island of Ceylon. Little
has as yet been done to stimulate the people to improve
their resources and ameliorate their condition
and habits; but of late years more attention has
been directed to these objects, and the trade with
British India has been rapidly on the increase.</p>

<p>China contains, it is estimated, not less than
350,000,000 of inhabitants, said to be inclined to
industry, and to be peculiarly addicted to traffic.
A timid and jealous system of government has for
ages hermetically sealed, as it were, this vast country
and population from intercourse with the rest
of the world. British valour has now removed the
barrier, and opened this almost new world to European
commerce.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the people of India and China
should, from improved intercourse, require to the
extent of one shilling <i>per annum</i>, for each individual,
in value of British manufacture or produce. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
this seemingly insignificant amount would produce
an annual increase of 25,000,000 in our exports.
The opening of the Canal route would tend greatly
to facilitate our intercourse with the 500,000,000 of
people who inhabit India and China, and hence its
commercial importance must be sufficiently obvious.</p>

<p>The application of steam power to the purposes
of navigation, is doubtless one of those mechanical
discoveries destined to effect a great moral revolution
in the human mind throughout the world. The
printing press has contributed, in an immense degree,
to the progress of civilization, by furnishing a
means for the spread of thought. But it seems
scarcely to admit of a question, that the power of
steam, applied to navigation, will exercise a more
extensive, a more rapid, and a more efficacious influence
in accelerating the civilization of the world
than even the printing press.</p>

<p>Five hundred millions of human beings inhabiting
Hindostan and China remain to this day enslaved
by debasing superstitions, and sunk in mental darkness
and delusion. What a field is here opening to
the Christian philanthropist! To aid in the removal
of ignorance and superstition by the diffusion
of useful knowledge, and an enlightened religion;
to plant industry and the arts where indolence and
barbarism have hitherto prevailed, are noble efforts,
tending no less to elevate those who engage in them,
than the object of their exertions. The opening of
the proposed communication would obviously subserve
the promotion of such objects, and therefore
can scarcely fail to excite an interest in the mind of
every sincere well-wisher to his fellow creatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The preceding statement and observations will,
I trust, be sufficient to show that the object of which
they treat is, at least, of sufficient importance to
warrant an effort being made to ascertain, in the
manner suggested, whether it be practicable or not,
and if found practicable, whether, and in what manner,
the Pacha of Egypt would be disposed to concur
or co-operate in it. If the information and suggestions
therein given should lead to such a result, the
chief object of their publication will be attained.</p>

<h3>OPINION OF CAPTAIN JAMES VETCH, R.E.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h3>

<p>A good deal is alleged by those trading from
Britain to the East Indies against the policy
of any part of the British nation lending patronage
to such an undertaking, which, it is presumed, would
benefit the countries bordering the Mediterranean
more than our own; though, if the canal in question
would be the means of most materially shortening
the distance between the two most important portions
of the British Empire, little doubt can be entertained
of the benefit conferred on the extensive commerce
of the two countries, even though some other nations
would receive a greater proportional advantage in
the accomplishment of the measure; and though the
commerce of other nations might increase in a
greater ratio than the British, still all would participate
in facilities to be obtained; and in the case
of war arising, it is but too obvious, that the power
possessing a naval superiority has the means of
closing such a channel of commerce to its enemies,
by stationing cruisers at each extremity. So much
may be urged with a view of removing the prejudice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of British interests against the measure; but it will
readily be believed, that if the British fail to patronize
the undertaking, other nations and powers
will do so shortly: and it is therefore manifest, if
British subjects were chiefly concerned in advancing
the capital, and in executing and managing this
great work, it would be vastly more for the benefit
of Britain, than if any other nation or Government
lent their resources. But undertake it who may,
it is most probable, that both the funds and the energies
of execution will come from this country; and
it is too probable, that if the measure is executed by
any other parties than British, the work will be upon
a cheaper and less effective plan of navigation, permitting
only small craft to navigate, unfit for British
commerce in the East, though sufficient for the small
traders in the Mediterranean, who would consequently,
in such a case, reap the entire benefit. I
am decidedly of opinion, that British capital and
British energy would alone execute the work in a
truly useful and permanent style. But the measure
is daily becoming so much more obvious as one of
practical facility, that it cannot long be postponed
in some shape or another.</p>

<p>The conclusions may now be recapitulated in
general terms:—</p>

<p>1st. That a ship canal between the two Seas, which
contemplates an extended commerce between the
countries of Europe and the Indian Ocean, should
be free from the effects of all fluctuating causes,
arising from inundations or floods, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2nd. That it should be a measure irrespective of
the commerce of Egypt and the Nile, or rather that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
it could not combine these objects in the same measure,
with any good results; though it would be the
means of greatly improving the commerce of Egypt
by accessory measures.</p>

<p>3rd. That the mean fall from the level of the Red
Sea to that of the Mediterranean (say thirty feet) is
sufficient to keep the artificial channel clean, if the
fall be properly economised; and also that it would
be able to preserve its mouth in the Bay of Pelusium
in a navigable state at all seasons.</p>

<p>4th. That a navigation of still water with locks
could not be long maintained with advantage, under
all the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>5th. That a broad and deep stream like that of
the Dardanelles could not be produced by natural
operations, assisted slightly by art; but that the
attempt would be pregnant with mischief in some
quarters, and result in disappointment.</p>

<p>6th. That a direct and perfectly controllable
channel, of a uniform size and shape and incline,
would be the safest and most appropriate undertaking
of which the circumstances permit, and under the
imperfect information we possess.</p>

<p>It must, however, be confessed, that no definitive
opinion can be given, or very satisfactory estimates
assumed, until a new and detailed survey, having
the express objects in view, is completed, comprehending
the necessary levellings and borings and
maritime surveys of the ports at the termini of the
Canal.</p>

<p>With respect to the land survey, were all the necessary
persons and means duly prepared to commence
operations in the beginning of October, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
probable the investigation might be completed in
the beginning of the following May, and a true solution
given to this great geographical, commercial,
and engineering question.</p>

<p>As mankind multiply and make progress in arts
and civilization, new wants arise, and the ingenuity
and industry of man is taxed to discover new sources
of wealth, maintenance, and occupation: and we
find, under the dispensations of an all-wise Providence,
that at suitable seasons resources are unveiled
which have been long provided but concealed until
the fit occasion presents itself. Amongst the numerous
administrations of the same wise and merciful
design, it is not unreasonable to believe that the completion
of navigable channels across the Isthmuses
of Suez and Darien are enterprises amongst the
events designed to minister to the growing wants and
improvement of the human race.</p>

<p class="tb">In the preceding pages an endeavour has been
made to show the superiority of a direct communication
between the two Seas (which would provide for
the speedy passage of large ships at all seasons), over
a communication partly through the medium of the
Nile, which would be interrupted in the dry season,
and prove tedious at all times; and it now remains
to say a few words on the comparative value of
railways.</p>

<p>Railways, under present circumstances, would
expedite the transmission of passengers by the steam
ships across the Desert, and might be useful in the
transmission of light and valuable goods between the
Nile and the Red Sea; but it must be greatly doubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
if a sufficient traffic could thereby arise to pay the
construction and maintenance of eighty miles of railway
between Cairo and Suez. On the other hand,
were it contemplated to construct a railway between
the bay of Tineh and Suez, the cost, including the
improvement of the harbours at either terminus,
would nearly equal the expense of the proposed Canal;
but the <i>means</i> of keeping the terminal harbours
deep and clean would be foregone from want of means
of scourage; and to the expense of the railway would
have to be added the expense of unloading and
reloading the cargoes of each shipment; so that it
is manifest that a railway direct between the two
Seas could stand no competition with the proposed
Canal, which, besides its value as a commercial channel,
would facilitate the steam navigation with India
in the highest degree, by permitting the steamers to
make a continuous voyage; and by permitting supplies
of coals being sent direct to Suez and Aden,
&amp;c., the detention of steamers at Suez and Alexandria
would be avoided, four or five days would be
gained in the transmission of passengers and mails,
and the expenditure in the price of coals would be
much reduced.</p>

<p>The Author again acknowledges his obligations
to the able statements of Mr. Maclaren’s paper of
1825, connected with this subject, and now quotes
that author’s opinions and those of the writer in the
Foreign Quarterly Review of 1836, as to the feasibility
of the proposed measure:—</p>

<p>“Yet it is certain that the project must not only
have been practicable but easy, since it was accomplished
in early times by men who were unprovided
with many of those resources which modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
art supplies. In fact, when the ground is explored
the supposed difficulties vanish, and we discover
that Nature has furnished such singular and unexpected
facilities for establishing a water communication
between the two Seas, that she has left
little for man to do to complete her work.”—<span class="smcap">Maclaren</span>,
<i>Jamieson’s Journal</i>, 1825, p. 274.</p>

<p>“Were European civilization and a regular Government
permanently re-established in Egypt,
the undertaking would be found not only practicable
but easy; so great, in fact, are the facilities
which the ground presents, that though the Canal
(taking the magnitude of its section into account)
would certainly be the largest that exists, the expense
would be considerably less than that of
some small works of the same kind executed in
the west of Europe.”—<i>Ibid.</i> p. 290.</p>

<p>“There is little doubt that if the French had
remained in Egypt, and especially with Napoleon
at the head of the Government, they would have
carried their project (of canals) into effect. The
expense, compared with the magnificent result, is
so trifling, that the wonder is that it has not been
carried into effect before now, either by a company
having the support of Mahommed Pacha, or
by the Pacha on his own account.”—<i>Foreign
Quarterly Review</i>, 1836, p. 362.</p>

<p>“A glance at the map which accompanies the
Topographical Survey of the French engineers is
quite sufficient to demonstrate with what facility
and at what moderate expense a ship’s canal
might be constructed from the Red Sea to the
Mediterranean.”—<i>Ibid.</i> p. 368.</p>

<h3><span class="smaller">FROM THE MONITEUR,<br />
(THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF FRANCE,)<br />
6th July, 1855.</span><br />
THE CUTTING OF THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ.</h3>

<p>This undertaking, one of the grandest and most
useful of the age, has for some time attracted
a considerable share of public attention. There is
but one opinion as to its immense results, but the
question of the track has been a subject of discussion,
which, in the absence of authentic documents and
an exact knowledge of the localities, may mislead
public opinion.</p>

<p>Two tracks have been proposed: one <i>direct</i>, which
is to unite the two Seas by a Canal in a straight line
from Suez to Pelusium; the other <i>indirect</i>, which,
starting from Suez, joins the Nile below Cairo, and
terminates at the port of Alexandria.</p>

<p>In the eyes of all who are acquainted with Egypt
the direct track alone appears practicable, the indirect
track however has recently found its advocates in
some European journals; the following particulars,
collected on the spot, will enlighten public opinion
upon this point.</p>

<p>In the first place there is a difference of length
between the two tracks, which is not unimportant.
The direct track being the shortest, would certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
not, of itself, be sufficient to give it the preference,
especially if the other were both most economical
and most advantageous; but it appears that besides
having the advantage of being much shorter, the
direct track also has the recommendations of being
more economical, more advantageous, and more easy
of execution.</p>

<p>1st. The indirect Canal has to cross the Nile, and
this condition is almost impossible to be carried out.
The crossings of rivers are attended, as is well known,
with difficulties, even when there is only a draught
of water of 2 to 3 <i>met.</i>: what would they be for a
Canal which is to be 8 <i>met.</i> deep? And even one of
the most decided partisans of the indirect track has
not hesitated to declare frankly, considering this
immense obstacle, which alarms but does not discourage
him: “that the maintenance of such a depth
presents difficulties which have never been surmounted
nor even attempted.” It is true that at first the help
of the barrage was reckoned upon in risking the
crossing of the river; but this barrage can only serve
at the low waters during four or five months of the
year, at the time when the lands are irrigated to prepare
for the summer crops; the reserved waters of
the Nile will never, even at their <i>maximum</i>, be more
than 4 to 4½ <i>met.</i>, which is very far from 8 <i>met.</i>
Above the barrage, at the point where the ships are
to cross, the breadth is 2000 <i>met.</i> and if a transverse
channel were dug there, how could it be prevented
from filling with alluvium and mud? During
the increase of the waters, how could a current of
five miles an hour, be crossed by sailing vessels
against the wind blowing from the east and south?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Against this formidable obstacle to the crossing
which cannot be avoided, an expedient not less surprising,
and still more impracticable, has been devised;
the barrage is set aside, the employment of it
being too hazardous, and the Nile is to be crossed by
a bridge Canal. But can we form an idea of a Canal
8 <i>met.</i> deep crossing a river like the Nile above the
barrage? According to the very calculations of those
who propose such schemes, there would be required
1,213,147 <i>met. cub.</i> of water <i>per diem</i> to supply the
upper basin, and as this enormous quantity of water
would have to be raised thirty <i>metres</i> above the level
of the two Seas; the engines required for this purpose
must represent 5620 horse power by calculation,
corresponding to 6000 horse power in those to be
provided; not to speak of the obstacles that such a
colossal work would oppose to the ordinary navigation,
it would be an expense upon that point only of
50 to 60,000,000 <i>francs</i>. And the bridge Canal
after all these sacrifices, would not be more firm or
more durable than any construction of that kind.
And moreover for this super elevation of level there
would be required ten locks in addition to the fourteen
already on the line.</p>

<p>2nd. The indirect Canal will be detrimental to
the Canal works, so necessary to Lower Egypt, and
will partly interfere with that admirable hydraulic
system, which is at once the pride and the fertilization
of the country. It will be in vain to make
circuits to avoid the branchings of the network; as
the termination is to be at the port of Alexandria,
it will be absolutely necessary to pass between the
Mahmoudieh Canal and Lake Mareotis; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the flow of all the waters into the Lake which is destined
to receive them will be prevented. Passing
through the Lake, as the railway does, seas of mire
will be met with, so much dreaded on the Pelusiac
coast. It has already been necessary to raise again
and again the embankment of the railway which was
disappearing in the Lake, and for three years it has
been necessary to labour unceasingly at the repairs
which are continually required; what will it be when
a dyke must be constructed at least 6000 <i>metres</i> in
length, to heights of 7 to 8 <i>metres</i>, without knowing
where to procure the necessary earth for these
embankments?</p>

<p>3rd. The indirect Canal cannot terminate in the
port of Alexandria without causing still greater confusion
there than it causes in the Canal works. In the
first place the port of Alexandria is not <i>immutable</i>,
as has been supposed. It has not escaped the action
of the ground swell, which has choked it with sand
to a good third of its extent. The part of the port
which has been selected is frequently agitated by the
north-west winds, and the surf is then so violent in
rough weather, that even small craft dare not approach
it. The rock is found there at a small depth below
the sea, and as it would be necessary to extend the
dykes of the Canal to 250 <i>metres</i> into the harbour, to
obtain a draught of water of 7 <i>met.</i>, 50 to 8 <i>met.</i>,
the rock would have to be excavated under the water.
Add to this that in this direction all the grand magazines
and all the Government works would be encountered;
there is not the least free space between
the railway and the Mahmoudieh canal. But let us
suppose all these difficulties overcome, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
others which the Canal raises, and which it multiplies
the more it is employed. The port of Alexandria,
the only military port of Egypt, is then
besieged by hundreds of merchant vessels, and by
the sailors of the whole of Europe. Let there be a
contrary wind ever so slight, or some requisite repairs
to the locks, and that the movement is arrested, just
fancy the impediment, without taking into account
the political dangers of such an accumulation. Moreover
it is not only at Alexandria that this intolerable
inconvenience would arise; it might happen, in
consequence of accidents easily to be foreseen but impossible
to be prevented, that Egypt should see all on
a sudden 8 to 10,000 foreign sailors stationed on a
point of her territory, because the forty vessels at
least which traverse it every day have been forcibly
detained at some part of the passage during twenty
or five and twenty days consecutively.</p>

<p>To these conclusive reasons, it would not be difficult
to add others; but these must be sufficient to
warn unbiassed minds against the indirect passage.</p>

<p>The inconveniences, or rather the impossibilities
of the indirect track, become more striking when
compared with the conditions of the direct track and
its incontestable advantages.</p>

<p>1st. To begin with, the direct track is only about
one third the length of the other. That would be
400 <i>kilometres</i> long, and the direct track is only
155, which would be reduced to 120, as will be seen.
Near about the middle of the Isthmus, the Bitter
Lakes are met with, which give 18 <i>kilometres</i> of
navigation ready made, and not requiring a single
turn of the shovel, as the Viceroy’s engineers say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and 18 <i>kilometres</i> in addition are three parts excavated
by nature itself; 120 <i>kilometres</i> therefore
remain, that is to say, 30 leagues at the most.</p>

<p>2nd. The direct track is the easiest. There are
only two salient points in the entire Isthmus that it
is necessary to traverse by partly turning them; one,
the Serapeum, which, according to the levels checked
in 1853, is 16 <i>met.</i>, 5950 high; and the other El
Guisr, which is 11 <i>met.</i>, 6300. With the depth of the
Canal, this would make a cutting of 20 or at most
24 <i>metres</i> at some points. There is certainly nothing
in such a work to terrify our engineers.</p>

<p>3rd. The direct track is the most natural. The
Isthmus is traversed by a longitudinal depression,
formed by the meeting of the two plains descending
with an imperceptible slope, the one from Egypt,
the other from the frontier hills of Asia. The Bitter
Lakes, filled with the waters of the Arabian Gulf by
the action of the tides only, may easily form a reservoir
which, with a surface of 280,000,000 <i>square
metres</i> by a rise of 2 <i>metres</i> of moving waters, would
not receive less than 560,000,000 <i>cubic metres</i>, for
the service of the Canal, below the water line at the
level of the two Seas. Lake Timsah, situated at about
an equal distance from Suez and Pelusium, is like an
inland port where ships can be revictualled and repaired.
Moreover, by another favour of nature,
towards Lake Timsah a second not less remarkable
hollow abuts perpendicularly on the longitudinal
depression, it is that of the Wady-Tomilat (the fertile
Goshen of the Bible). This hollow still receives the
overflowings of the Nile for a great part of its length,
and forms the natural track of a communication starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
from the river and joining, at the central part
of the Isthmus, the line of maritime navigation which
would be established between the Arabian Gulf and
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>4th. The direct track is the most useful. It serves
at the same time the interests of commerce in general
and the political interests of Egypt and the Ottoman
Empire. It will require but little to maintain it, and
as there will be very few works of art, navigation
will not be exposed to those interruptions which it
would have to dread on the indirect track.</p>

<p>To these evident advantages of the direct track,
to these relative facilities which had attracted the
attention of the sovereigns of Egypt, of Amrou and
Mustapha III. for example (see Lebeau, <i>Histoire du
Bas-Empire</i>, tom. <span class="smcapuc">XII.</span> p. 490, and the <i>Mémoires
du Baron de Tott sur les Turcs</i>, pts. <span class="smcapuc">III.</span> and <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span>),
before attracting that of the nineteenth century, there
is but one objection, and it is this:—</p>

<p>It is impossible, they say, for large ships to approach
Pelusium; and the direct Canal is chimerical, because
it cannot open into the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>This oft-repeated objection is but specious, and
cannot stand before an examination of the facts.
The entrance to Pelusium is certainly a difficult and
costly work, but it is perfectly practicable, and
engineers have overcome very different obstacles with
resources much inferior to those now at their command.</p>

<p>It is well in the first place that it should be known
that the level of the two Seas, excepting the difference
of the tides, which are pretty high at the south in the
Red Sea, and almost nothing at the north in the
Mediterranean, is perceptibly the same. The commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of 1799 had found for the Arabian Gulf an
elevation of 9 <i>met.</i> 90; but its labours, performed
in the midst of all the dangers and disturbances of
war, had not been verified, and the genius of Laplace
resting upon accurate theoretical views, had formally
denied the possibility of such a depression within a distance
of scarcely thirty leagues. Afterwards, towards
1840, some English officers had proved by the barometer
and the boiling water process that there was no
difference of level; and in 1843, Prince Metternich,
having been informed of these labours, sent instructions
to Egypt to induce Mehemet Ali to interest
himself in the grand undertaking of the cutting of
the Isthmus: his dispatch is still in the Archives of
the Austrian Consulate at Alexandria. In 1847 a
commission of French engineers, sent out by M.
Paulin Talabot under the direction of the learned
M. Bourdaloue, and assisted by Egyptian engineers
directed by M. Linant, chief engineer to the Viceroy,
put the fact beyond all question, and M. Paulin
Talabot had the honour of stating it in a memorial
that has become famous. Our Academy of Sciences
bestirred itself for the honour of the ancient Egyptian
commission. M. Sabatier, Consul general of France,
asked the Viceroy for a fresh verification, which M.
Linant was charged to undertake in 1853, and which
confirmed, saying an insignificant variation, the labours
of 1847.</p>

<p>So that the considerable super-elevation of the
Red Sea cannot be reckoned on for facilitating the
approaches from the Mediterranean at the other extremity
of the Canal; there is only the difference
of the tides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>As a depth of 7 <i>met.</i> 50 to 8 <i>met.</i> is not found
before Pelusium or Tineh, but at a distance of 6000
<i>met.</i> into the sea, it is assumed that it is practically
impossible to prolong the jetty of the Canal to that
distance, because the waters are but <i>liquid mud</i>, and
that <i>clouds of earth</i> would interfere with the progress
of the vessels and the solidity of the works.</p>

<p>This is a complete mistake.</p>

<p>Because Herodotus has said, that the Delta is a
present from the Nile, his inaccurate assertion has
been repeated without verifying it, and his metaphor
has passed for an incontestable truth. But it is an
absolute fact, and it is only necessary to ask those
who have been at Pelusium, that the water there is
as limpid as at Alexandria or Jaffa. The banks of
<i>travelling mud</i> seen by Admiral Sir Sidney Smith
have no more reality than the <i>present from the Nile</i>,
and for the twenty years that these coasts have been
traversed in every direction by steam boats, no one
has ever met again with those muddy banks. The
truth is, that the waters of the Nile, which, at the
time of the inundation are distinguished for more
than ten leagues into the sea, carry far out into the
Mediterranean and deposit in its depths, the masses
of earthy matter which they hold in suspension (near
1/8000) which do not reappear on the coasts but
in imperceptible quantities; the truth is, that a handful
of sand may be taken up from the sea beach, at
Pelusium, without finding the least particle of mud.
The Viceroy’s engineers have proved that the coast,
from El-Arish to Tripoli, is pure sand, and the
soundings taken along the shore give the same result.
Far from the Nile forming accretions at Pelusium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
it is an axiom now admitted by science that the
muddy or sandy deposits observed at the mouths of
rivers are entirely owing to matters brought by the
tide. The rivers have no part therein; and the excellent
observations made by most able hydrographers
at the bay of Mount St. Michael, at the
mouths of the Scheld, the Meuse, the Rhine, the
Yssel, have superabundantly proved it. The accumulations
of sand at Pelusium and Suez, like the
whole Isthmus, have been formed by the maritime
deposits of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.
The thorough investigation of the motion of the waves
has demonstrated that the bars of rivers are due to
the ground swell alone. The Nile, therefore, has no
influence upon the approaches to Pelusium, as Herodotus
supposed, and as is still the common opinion;
and this is so true, that for 20 <i>kilometres</i> above its
mouth there are accretions of mud, while below there
is nothing but sand. Finally the accumulations
of sand are more considerable in proportion as the
waters of the river are less abundant.</p>

<p>Setting aside from the question the hypothetical
assertions, it remains therefore incontestable that the
only difficulty at Pelusium, is the length of the jetties
in the sea. Pelusium, with its ruins, is at the same
point where Strabo saw it, where the Egyptian commission
saw it, which found the twenty stadia of the
Greek geographer between the shore and the town
quite correct. But are jetties of a league and a half
into the sea possible, or are they indeed a work that
cannot be executed? The answer to this question is
easy: a hundred years ago, the Hollanders, not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
rich and not so skillful as we are now, although quite
as bold, erected at the Cape, in the bay of the Lion,
at a depth of 16 <i>met.</i>, in spite of the most frightful tempests,
a dyke of 8000 <i>metres</i>, that is, a work of at
least four times the extent of that required for the
entrance of the Canal at Pelusium.</p>

<p>As for the harbour of Suez, the work there would
be comparatively trifling because it is sheltered from
all the winds, excepting that from the south-east,
and ships keep the sea there very well, as is proved
by the English Magazine corvette, moored there for
two years, without sustaining any damage.</p>

<p>What is to be deduced from these observations?—That
it is possible to make a canal 100 <i>metres</i> wide
from Suez to Pelusium, with a draught of water of
8 <i>met.</i>, below low water in the Mediterranean, with
parapets, towing path, &amp;c. and available for the passage
of screw and paddle frigates, and vessels of
1000 to 1500 tons burthen, and that this canal, following
the straight line between the two Seas is the
only practicable one, as it will be one of the grandest
and most useful works ever performed by man.</p>

<p>To conclude, this track is the only one that the
prince who now rules in Egypt will allow. Well
informed himself in nautical arts and sciences, the
inheritor of the policy of Mehemet Ali, which he
approves while he practises, he has declared in dictating
his own terms for the firman of concession,
that he would have the shortest and least expensive
track, and one that would be available for the largest
ships. It is not in the scheme of an inland canal
that the real junction of the two Seas consists; the
indirect canal cuts through Egypt, and not the Isthmus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
its extent is not only tripled, but the cost of
execution and maintenance are enormous, and the
existence of a canal constructed upon these conditions
would be always uncertain and precarious while
the direct track, which unites so many advantages,
has none of these drawbacks.</p>

the Isthmus of Suez. The great influence which your character
and your long experience naturally give you the right
to exercise in the decisions of your Government on all Eastern
questions, makes me especially anxious to neglect no
opportunity of enabling Your Excellency to form an opinion
from a perfect acquaintance with the case.</p>

<p>The results already obtained from the intimate alliance
of France and England, testify sufficiently to the advantages
that the European balance and civilization in general
derive from that union of the two peoples. The future and
the welfare of all the nations of the universe are therefore
concerned in maintaining intact, in preserving from any
attack, a state of things, which, to the everlasting honour
of the Governments that have brought it about, can alone,
with time, ensure the blessings of progress and of peace to
the human race. Thence the necessity of getting rid,
beforehand, of all causes of rupture, or even of coolness,
between the two peoples; thence, consequently, the paramount
duty of anticipating amongst future contingencies,
those circumstances calculated to awake ancient feelings of
antagonism, and to raise, in the bosom of either nation,
those emotions against the violence of which, the wisdom
of Governments is powerless to struggle. The motives for
hostile rivalry are tending successively to give place to that
generous emulation which gives birth to great things.</p>

<p>Looking at the situation of affairs in a general way, it is
scarcely to be perceived upon what ground and upon what
occasion, those struggles, which so long desolated the world,
could be renewed. Is it financial and commercial interests
that could cause division between the two peoples? Why,
British capital thrown into all the undertakings of France,
and the immense developement of international commerce,
have established ties between them which become closer
every day. Is it political interests and questions of principle?
Why, the two nations have but one common aim,
one same ambition: the triumph of right over might, of
civilization over barbarism. Is it, finally, a sordid jealousy
of territorial extension? Why, they acknowledge, at the
present time, that the globe is vast enough to offer to the
spirit of adventure that animates their respective populations,
countries to make available, human beings to withdraw
from the state of barbarism; and, moreover, from the
moment that their flags wave together, the conquests of the
one profit by the activity of the other.</p>

<p>At the first glance, then, nothing is perceived in the
general state of affairs that could impair our cordial relations
with England.</p>

<p>If, however, we look closer, an eventuality presents itself
which, causing the most enlightened and most moderate
cabinets to partake in popular prejudices and passions, is
capable of reviving old antipathies, and of compromising,
with the alliance, the benefits to be derived from it.</p>

<p>There is, in fact, a point of the globe with the free passage
of which the political and commercial power of Great
Britain is bound up, a point, the possession of which France
had, on her part, aspired to in former times. This point is
Egypt, the direct route from Europe to India, Egypt bathed
once and again with French blood.</p>

<p>It is superfluous to define the motives which would not
allow England to see Egypt in the possession of a rival
nation without opposing it by the most energetic resistance;
but what should also be taken into serious consideration,
is, that with less positive interests, France under the dominion
of her glorious traditions, under the impression of other
feelings more instinctive than rational, and therefore more
powerful over the impressionable spirit of her inhabitants,
would not, in her turn, leave to England the peaceable
sovereignty of Egypt. It is clear that, so long as the route
to India is open and certain, that the state of the country
ensures the facility and promptitude of the communications,
England will not set about creating the most grave difficulties
by appropriating a territory which, in her eyes, has no
other value than as a means of transit. It is likewise evident
that France—whose policy, for the last fifty years, has
been to contribute to the prosperity of Egypt, both by her
counsels and by the concourse of a great number of Frenchmen
distinguished in the sciences, in administrative capacity,
in all the arts of peace or war—will not seek to realize, in
this direction, the projects of another epoch, so long as
England does not interfere.</p>

<p>But let one of those crises occur which have so often
shaken the East, let a circumstance arise wherein England
should find herself under the rigorous necessity of taking a
position in Egypt to prevent another power from forestalling
her, and tell us then if it is possible that the alliance
could survive the complications which such an event would
occasion. And why should England consider herself obliged
to become mistress of Egypt, even at the risk of
breaking her alliance with France? For this single reason,
that Egypt is the shortest and most direct route from England
to her Eastern possessions; that this route must be
constantly open to her; and that, in whatever concerns this
mighty interest, she could never temporise. Thus, from the
position given to her by nature, Egypt might still become
the subject of a conflict between France and Great Britain;
so that this chance of rupture would disappear if, by a providential
event, the geographical conditions of the ancient
world were changed, and, that the commercial route to
India, instead of passing through the heart of Egypt, were
removed to its confines, and, being opened to all the world,
could never be exposed to the chance of its becoming the
exclusive privilege of any one.</p>

<p>Well! this event, which must have been the design of
Providence, is now within the reach of man. It may be
brought about by human skill. It is to be realized by the
cutting of the Isthmus of Suez, an undertaking to which
nature opposes no obstacle, and wherein English capital, as
well as that of other countries, will certainly take part.</p>

<p>Let the Isthmus be cut through, let the waves of the
Mediterranean mingle with those of the Indian Ocean, let
the Railroad be continued and completed, and Egypt, in
acquiring an increased importance as a productive country,
as a country of internal commerce, as a general storehouse
and common transit, loses its dangerous pre-eminence as
an uncertain and contested passage of communication.</p>

<p>The possession of its territory being no longer an object of
interest to England, ceases to be a possible bone of contention
between that power and France, the union of the
two peoples is for the future unalterable, and the world is
preserved from the calamities which a rupture between them
would produce. This result affords such securities for the
future, that it is sufficient to point them out, to attract to the
undertaking destined to produce it, the sympathy and the
encouragement of the Statesmen whose efforts are directed
to the settlement of the Anglo-French alliance upon an immoveable
basis. You, my Lord, are one of those Statesmen,
and you have too large a share in questions of high
policy, to which I am a stranger, for me not to entertain
the wish to communicate to you my aspirations.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
